### 1.3 Research Objectives
**List format:**
1.  To develop a novel theoretical framework connecting OSS's core mechanisms to specific pathways for achieving global impact across environmental, social, and economic dimensions.
2.  To demonstrate the application and utility of this framework through illustrative case studies of OSS projects contributing to sustainability and societal well-being.
3.  To identify the challenges and opportunities in measuring and governing the impact of OSS, proposing actionable directions for policy and practice.

### 1.4 Contributions
**Bullet format:**

## Next Steps

After formatting:
1.  Review against journal guidelines (generic for "Technology/Social Impact Journal")
2.  Ensure all placeholders are noted (e.g., `[Placeholder for conceptual diagram]`, `[VERIFY]`)
3.  Proceed to Compose phase with clear structure and citation instructions
4.  Save to `outline_formatted.md`

---

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines (Crafters will handle this during content generation, but the structure must anticipate it).
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics.
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with `[VERIFY]` or `[TODO]` (especially for specific data points or detailed examples in case studies).
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments.
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support (e.g., literature review, theoretical underpinnings, comparative discussion).

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
