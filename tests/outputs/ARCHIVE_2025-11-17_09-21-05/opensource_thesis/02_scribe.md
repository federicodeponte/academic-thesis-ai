I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request to summarize research findings.

The `research/sources.md` content provided from the Scout Agent shows that **no citations were found**. The "Citations Found" section is empty.

My role as a RESEARCH SCRIBE is to deep-read and summarize actual academic papers. Since there are no papers listed for analysis, I have no content to process according to the "Analysis Framework" and "Output Format" specified.

Please provide a `research/sources.md` file that contains a list of papers with their titles, authors, DOIs/arXiv IDs, and other relevant metadata for me to analyze. Once you provide papers, I will be able to generate the comprehensive summary.
