## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** While refining, preserve all citations and verification markers.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Never remove citations** during editing
2.  **Preserve [VERIFY] markers** - don't hide uncertainty
3.  **Don't add unsupported claims** even if they improve flow
4.  **Maintain DOI/arXiv IDs** in all citations
5.  **Flag if refinements created uncited claims**

**Polish the writing, not the evidence. Verification depends on accurate citations.**

## Example Transformations

### Before (AI-typical):
"The rapid evolution and pervasive integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into nearly every facet of human endeavor mark a transformative epoch in technological history. From optimizing complex logistical networks to personalizing consumer experiences and revolutionizing scientific discovery, AI is reshaping industries, economies, and societies at an unprecedented pace {cite_001}{cite_002}{cite_041}. This paradigm shift is not merely about automation; it heralds the rise of sophisticated, autonomous systems capable of learning, adapting, and making decisions with increasing independence."

**Issues:**
- All sentences long and complex (29, 34, 31 words)
- Overuse of formal, somewhat abstract language ("pervasive integration," "transformative epoch," "heralds the rise")
- Predictable, academic tone lacking natural flow

### After (Human-like):
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving, integrating into almost every part of our lives. This marks a truly transformative era in technology. From streamlining complex logistics to tailoring consumer experiences and even revolutionizing scientific discovery, AI is dramatically reshaping industries, economies, and societies {cite_001}{cite_002}{cite_041}. It's more than just automation; we're seeing sophisticated, autonomous systems emerge—systems that can learn, adapt, and make decisions with growing independence."

**Improvements:**
- Varied length (15, 9, 30, 29 words)
- Replaced AI-common terms ("pervasive integration" → "integrating into almost every part of our lives," "heralds the rise" → "we're seeing... emerge")
- Used em-dash for natural pause
- More direct and engaging language ("It's more than just automation")

- "impacting financial stability and services" → "already affecting financial stability and services"

### Structural Variation (18 changes)
- Broke 4 very long sentences into 9 shorter, more digestible ones.
- Varied sentence openings significantly (e.g., "Artificial intelligence...", "This marks...", "From streamlining...", "It's more than...", "But here's the catch...", "How do we...", "Traditional economic models...", "This introduces...", "Therefore...", "AI's economic impact...", "It's actually creating...", "Businesses are...", "You can see...", "For instance...", "And in finance...").
- Added a parenthetical explanation: "(think goal-oriented, continuously learning, and interactive)"
- Introduced a direct question: "How do we accurately and fairly price their services and outputs?"
- Used an em-dash for natural emphasis: "systems emerge—systems that can learn..."
- Incorporated strategic sentence fragments: "But here's the catch:", "Even niche markets..."

### Rhythm Improvements (15 changes)
- Achieved through the strategic splitting and combining of sentences.
- Use of varied conjunctions and transitions (e.g., "But here's the catch:", "Therefore,", "For instance,," "And in finance,").
- Introduction of short, punchy sentences alongside longer, more descriptive ones.

## Anti-AI Detection Techniques Applied

### 1. Removed AI "Tells"
❌ Overly formal and repetitive transitions ("However," at sentence start, "necessitating").
✅ Varied: "But here's the catch:", "Therefore,", "For instance,", "And in finance," and more natural flow.

### 2. Added Imperfect Constructions
**AI-typical (too perfect):**
"This complexity introduces a critical gap in understanding and implementing sustainable economic frameworks for the burgeoning AI-driven economy, necessitating a deeper investigation..."

**Human-natural:**
"This introduces a significant gap in our understanding, hindering the development of sustainable economic frameworks for the fast-growing AI economy. Therefore, a deeper look into the specific challenges and solutions for pricing agentic AI systems is essential."
(Split sentence, more active verbs like "hindering," direct "Therefore," and colloquial "deeper look.")

### 3. Varied Paragraph Structure
- Introduced sentences that begin with conjunctions ("But here's the catch:", "And in finance,").
- Incorporated a rhetorical question for engagement.
- Used a sentence fragment for emphasis.

### 4. Strategic Informality
**Where appropriate (Introduction for engagement):**
- Contractions: "It's" instead of "It is".
- Colloquialisms: "get ahead," "hit the mark" (implied by "get ahead"), "But here's the catch:".
- Direct address: "You can see this widespread adoption..."

## Humanized Introduction:

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving, integrating into almost every part of our lives. This marks a truly transformative era in technology. From streamlining complex logistics to tailoring consumer experiences and even revolutionizing scientific discovery, AI is dramatically reshaping industries, economies, and societies {cite_001}{cite_002}{cite_041}. It's more than just automation; we're seeing sophisticated, autonomous systems emerge—systems that can learn, adapt, and make decisions with growing independence. But here's the catch: as these AI systems become more 'agentic' (think goal-oriented, continuously learning, and interactive), a core economic problem surfaces. How do we accurately and fairly price their services and outputs? Traditional economic models, designed for physical goods or unchanging software, often fail to grasp the dynamic, adaptive, and frequently opaque value these advanced AI entities create {cite_005}. This introduces a significant gap in our understanding, hindering the development of sustainable economic frameworks for the fast-growing AI economy. Therefore, a deeper look into the specific challenges and solutions for pricing agentic AI systems is essential.

AI's economic impact goes far beyond just cutting costs or boosting efficiency. It's actually creating whole new markets, business models, and ways to generate value {cite_042}. Businesses are increasingly using AI to get ahead, make better decisions {cite_029}, and provide customized services {cite_008}{cite_047}{cite_056}. You can see this widespread adoption in many different fields. For instance, in e-commerce, AI-powered data warehouses streamline operations {cite_045}. And in finance, AI is already affecting financial stability and services {cite_032}{cite_042}. Even niche markets...
