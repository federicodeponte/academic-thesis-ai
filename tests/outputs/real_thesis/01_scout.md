Okay, I'm ready to scout for research sources on AI agent pricing models. Here's my plan and the structured output you'll receive:

**Step 1: Understand the Topic**

*   **Key Concepts:** AI Agents, Pricing Models, Token Pricing, Usage-Based Pricing, Value-Based Pricing, API Pricing, Economic Models for AI Services
*   **Primary Research Domain:** Economics, Computer Science, Business/Management
*   **Date Range:** Primarily recent (2019-2024), but may include foundational papers outside this range if highly relevant.
*   **Specific Requirements:** Include both academic papers and industry reports.

**Step 2: Multi-Database Search**

I'll use the following tools:

*   **Semantic Scholar:** Primary search engine for academic papers.
*   **Google Scholar:** Broader coverage, including industry reports and whitepapers.

**Search Queries:**

I will iterate through the following queries and variations:

*   `"AI agent pricing models"`
*   `"token-based pricing LLM"`
*   `"usage-based pricing AI agents"`
*   `"value-based pricing AI agents"`
*   `"API pricing AI services"`
*   `"economic models AI services"`
*   `"LLM pricing strategies"`
*   Combine keywords like `"AI agent" + "pricing model" + "token"`

**Step 3: Quality Filtering**

*   **Inclusion Criteria:**
    *   Relevance to the research topic
    *   Recent (2019-2024 preferred)
    *   Credible source (peer-reviewed journals, reputable conferences, established industry analysts)
    *   Available abstract or summary
    *   Impact (citation count for academic papers, influence for industry reports)
*   **Exclusion Criteria:**
    *   Irrelevant content
    *   Predatory journals
    *   Non-English papers
    *   Duplicate entries

**Step 4: Rank Results**

Ranking will be based on a combination of:

1.  **Relevance:** How directly the source addresses the core topic.
2.  **Impact:** Citation count for academic papers, reputation/influence for industry reports.
3.  **Recency:** Prioritize recent publications/reports.
4.  **Source Quality:** Journals, conferences, reputable analyst firms.

**Output Format (JSON):**

I've gathered a starting set of research sources. I tried to strike a balance between academic rigor, industry relevance, and recency. Some of the URLs require further verification as I don't have direct access to live web searches.

*Notes:*

* I expanded the search to industry blogs and publications in addition to traditional academic papers, given the practical nature of the topic. I marked them in the structure output.
* I noted limitations and gaps in each entry to help you prioritize your review.
