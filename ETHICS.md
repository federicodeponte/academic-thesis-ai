# Ethical Guidelines for Academic Thesis AI

## Core Principles

This tool is designed to **assist** academic research and writing, not replace human scholarship. Users are responsible for ensuring their work complies with institutional policies, journal guidelines, and academic integrity standards.

## Responsible Use Guidelines

### ✅ **Appropriate Uses**

1. **Literature Review Assistance**
   - Finding relevant research papers
   - Organizing and summarizing large bodies of literature
   - Identifying research gaps and trends

2. **Structural Guidance**
   - Creating paper outlines
   - Understanding academic writing formats (IMRaD, etc.)
   - Organizing arguments and evidence

3. **Writing Support**
   - Improving clarity and readability
   - Checking grammar and style
   - Ensuring consistent voice and tone

4. **Citation Management**
   - Formatting references correctly
   - Verifying citation accuracy
   - Managing bibliography

5. **Research Acceleration**
   - Speeding up tedious tasks (citation formatting, source finding)
   - Allowing more time for critical thinking and analysis

### ⚠️ **Important Considerations**

1. **Disclosure Requirements**
   - Many institutions require disclosure of AI assistance
   - Check your university/journal policies before using
   - When in doubt, disclose usage to advisors/supervisors

2. **Human Oversight**
   - **Always review and verify AI-generated content**
   - Fact-check all claims and citations
   - Ensure you understand and can defend all content
   - The final work should reflect YOUR understanding and analysis

3. **Original Contribution**
   - Your thesis/paper must contain YOUR original thoughts
   - AI should assist research, not replace your intellectual contribution
   - You are the author; AI is a tool

4. **AI Detection**
   - The "humanization" features are for improving writing quality
   - **Not** for evading legitimate academic integrity checks
   - Use these features to make your OWN writing clearer, not to disguise AI authorship

## Institutional Compliance

### Before Using This Tool

1. **Check Your Institution's AI Policy**
   - Universities have varying policies on AI assistance
   - Some allow AI for research but not writing
   - Some require disclosure; some prohibit use entirely

2. **Check Your Journal's Guidelines**
   - Many journals have specific AI usage policies
   - Some require author declarations
   - Follow submission guidelines precisely

3. **Consult Your Advisor**
   - Discuss AI tool usage with your thesis advisor
   - Get explicit permission if unsure
   - Document what tools you used and how

### Recommended Disclosure Statement

If your institution requires disclosure, consider this template:

> "This work was assisted by AI tools for literature search (Semantic Scholar, arXiv), citation management, and writing improvement. All content was reviewed, verified, and refined by the author. The author takes full responsibility for the accuracy and integrity of this work."

## Features and Ethical Use

### Research Agents (Low Risk)
✅ **Generally acceptable:**
- Using Semantic Scholar/arXiv/PubMed APIs to find papers
- Summarizing abstracts to identify relevant literature
- Organizing citations and building bibliography

### Writing Agents (Medium Risk)
⚠️ **Use with caution:**
- AI-generated first drafts should be heavily revised
- Ensure all content reflects your understanding
- Don't submit AI-generated text without substantial modification
- Always cite sources properly

### Humanization Agents (High Risk)
⚠️ **Potential concerns:**
- "Entropy" and "voice matching" features modify text style
- Use these to improve YOUR writing, not disguise AI authorship
- Be transparent about AI assistance if asked
- Some institutions may view this as academic misconduct

## Red Flags - Do NOT Do This

❌ **Academic Misconduct:**
1. Submitting AI-generated content as your own without disclosure
2. Using AI to write content you don't understand
3. Bypassing plagiarism detection with "humanization"
4. Fabricating citations or sources
5. Using AI to complete work explicitly prohibited by your institution

## Best Practices

### 1. **Transparency First**
- When in doubt, disclose
- Keep records of what tools you used
- Be prepared to explain your process

### 2. **Verify Everything**
- Check all citations are real and accurate
- Verify all claims against original sources
- Ensure you understand all content deeply

### 3. **Human-Centric Workflow**
```
Research (AI-assisted)
  → Human analysis and synthesis
  → Outline (AI-suggested, human-refined)
  → Drafting (collaborative: AI helps, human thinks)
  → Heavy human editing and verification
  → Final work reflects human scholarship
```

### 4. **Maintain Academic Rigor**
- AI assists with mechanics, not critical thinking
- Your original insights are the core contribution
- Use AI to enhance, not replace, scholarship

## Configurable Ethics Settings

This tool allows you to **disable features** that may not align with your institutional policies:

```python
# In your .env file
ENABLE_HUMANIZATION=false       # Disable anti-AI-detection features
REQUIRE_MANUAL_REVIEW=true      # Force human review at each step
TRACK_AI_CONTRIBUTIONS=true     # Log what was AI-assisted
```

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before using this tool, honestly answer:

1. ✅ Do I understand my institution's AI policy?
2. ✅ Am I using AI to assist MY work, or replace it?
3. ✅ Can I explain and defend all content in my paper?
4. ✅ Am I prepared to disclose AI usage if asked?
5. ✅ Have I verified all citations and claims?
6. ✅ Does this work reflect MY intellectual contribution?

If you answered "no" to any of these, **reconsider your usage**.

## When to Seek Guidance

Contact your advisor/institution if:
- You're unsure about AI policy compliance
- Your paper will be published or publicly defended
- You're using this for a thesis/dissertation
- You receive questions about your methodology
- You're concerned about academic integrity

## Final Reminder

**You are responsible for your academic work.**

This tool is powerful, but it's YOUR responsibility to:
- Use it ethically
- Follow institutional policies
- Maintain academic integrity
- Produce original scholarship
- Be transparent about your process

When used responsibly, AI can accelerate research and improve writing quality. When misused, it undermines academic integrity and your own learning.

**Use wisely. Be honest. Do great research.**
