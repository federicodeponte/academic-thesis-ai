## MAJOR ISSUES (Must Address)

None. The text is robust and well-supported, avoiding significant overclaims or logical flaws.

---

## MODERATE ISSUES (Should Address)

### Issue 1: Implicit vs. Explicit Thesis Limitations
**Location:** Overall Conclusion (could be placed after the "Beitrag dieser Arbeit" section, before "Zukünftige Forschung")
**Problem:** While the conclusion effectively discusses the inherent limitations and challenges of Emissionshandelssysteme (ETS) themselves (e.g., price volatility, carbon leakage), it does not explicitly reflect on the limitations of *this specific Master's thesis*. Acknowledging the scope, depth, or specific focus areas chosen for the thesis is a standard practice that enhances academic humility and rigor.
**Missing:** A brief paragraph or a few sentences outlining the boundaries of the work, such as the specific timeframe of literature reviewed, the number/type of case studies analyzed, or any constraints on the depth of empirical analysis.
**Fix:** Add a short paragraph explicitly stating the limitations of *this Master's thesis*. For example, "Trotz der umfassenden Analyse ist diese Arbeit im Rahmen einer Masterarbeit notwendigerweise auf die Synthese vorhandener Literatur beschränkt und konnte beispielsweise keine primären empirischen Daten erheben oder eine detaillierte quantitative Modellierung durchführen. Die Auswahl der Fallstudien konzentrierte sich auf X und Y, was weitere Vergleiche in anderen regionalen Kontexten offenlässt."
**Severity:** 🟡 Moderate - important for academic completeness and setting expectations.

## MINOR ISSUES

1.  **Slightly Overconfident Aspiration:**
    *   **Location:** Paragraph 5, last sentence ("Die Erkenntnisse dieser Masterarbeit dienen somit als wertvolle Grundlage für politische Entscheidungsträger und Wissenschaftler...")
    *   **Problem:** While aspirational, "wertvolle Grundlage" (valuable basis) might be slightly strong for a Master's thesis primarily based on a literature review. It implies a direct and significant impact on policy-making.
    *   **Fix:** Soften the phrasing slightly. Consider "können als eine solide Grundlage dienen", "tragen zur Diskussionsgrundlage bei", or "bieten wichtige Denkanstöße für politische Entscheidungsträger und Wissenschaftler".

2.  **Reinforce "Systematische Literaturanalyse":**
    *   **Location:** Paragraph 1, sentence 3 ("auf Basis einer systematischen Literaturanalyse...")
    *   **Problem:** The term "systematisch" implies a specific methodology (e.g., defined search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria). While the full methodology belongs in a dedicated section, a brief reinforcing phrase in the conclusion could strengthen the claim.
    *   **Fix:** Briefly elaborate or hint at the rigor, e.g., "auf Basis einer systematischen Literaturanalyse relevanter Studien der letzten Dekade..." or "auf Basis einer umfassenden und systematischen Literaturanalyse..." (This is very minor, almost stylistic).

3.  **Specificity of "Fallstudien":**
    *   **Location:** Paragraph 1, sentence 3 ("und der Untersuchung relevanter Fallstudien")
    *   **Problem:** Similar to the point above, if the "Untersuchung" of case studies was primarily a comparative *review of existing literature on* case studies, rather than a deep, primary analysis, it might be beneficial to clarify this implicitly or explicitly. Paragraph 5's mention of EU ETS and China helps, but the initial statement could be more precise.
    *   **Fix:** Ensure the wording aligns precisely with the actual methodological approach. If it was a review of case studies *from the literature*, consider "und der Analyse von Erkenntnissen aus relevanten Fallstudien" or similar. (Also very minor).

## Logical Gaps

None identified. The reasoning flows well from the stated purpose to findings, contributions, and future research.

---

## Methodological Concerns (as reflected in the Fazit)

### Concern 1: Scope and Depth of Methodological Claims
**Issue:** The Fazit claims "systematischer Literaturanalyse und der Untersuchung relevanter Fallstudien" as the basis of the work. While the conclusion section itself cannot detail the methodology, the absence of explicit limitations (as raised in Moderate Issue 1) could lead a reviewer to question the *depth* or *breadth* of these methods within the constraints of a Master's thesis.
**Risk:** Reviewers might infer that the scope was broader than actually feasible or that the systematic nature wasn't as rigorous as implied, if not explicitly contextualized.
**Reviewer Question:** "What specific criteria defined 'relevante Fallstudien' and how were they analyzed? Was the systematic literature analysis conducted according to established protocols (e.g., PRISMA)?" (These are questions for the main body of the thesis, but the conclusion should reflect the scope honestly).
**Suggestion:** Addressing Moderate Issue 1 will largely mitigate this concern by setting realistic expectations for the thesis's scope.

---

## Missing Discussions

The "Zukünftige Forschung" section is very comprehensive and effectively addresses areas that might otherwise be considered missing discussions (e.g., optimal integration of instruments, role in developing countries, long-term impacts, international coordination).

---

## Tone & Presentation Issues

1.  **Slightly Overconfident Aspiration:** (Addressed in Minor Issues) The phrasing "dienen somit als wertvolle Grundlage" could be slightly softened to maintain an appropriate academic tone for a Master's thesis.

---

## Questions a Reviewer Will Ask

1.  "Given the reliance on literature, what were the most significant gaps or inconsistencies in the existing research that your thesis specifically aimed to clarify or synthesize?"
2.  "How did the methodological approach (e.g., systematic literature review, case study analysis) specifically enable you to draw the conclusions presented, particularly regarding the 'differentiated picture'?"
3.  "The thesis highlights social justice. What specific recommendations or considerations for policy design emerged from your analysis concerning equitable distribution effects of carbon pricing?"
4.  "Beyond the EU ETS and China, did your literature review touch upon the experiences or unique challenges of ETS in other regions, especially emerging economies?"
5.  "How do the identified future research directions specifically build upon the limitations or unresolved questions that became apparent during *your own* research process?"

**Prepare answers or consider briefly incorporating reflections on these points into the paper's conclusion or discussion.**

## Revision Priority

**Before resubmission:**
1.  🟡 Address Issue 1 (Explicit Thesis Limitations) - improves academic completeness and rigor.
2.  🟢 Soften the wording in Minor Issue 1 ("wertvolle Grundlage").

**Can defer:**
-   Minor wording suggestions for "systematische Literaturanalyse" and "Fallstudien" (Minor Issues 2 & 3) can be considered stylistic improvements if desired, but are not critical for acceptance.
