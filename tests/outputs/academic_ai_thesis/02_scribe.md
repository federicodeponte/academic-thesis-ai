## Gaps for Further Investigation

Based on these papers, gaps to explore:
1.  **Empirical Studies on Long-term Impact of LLM-based Agents on Human Research Skills:** While papers discuss AI anxiety (6) and academic integrity (15), there's a gap in robust, long-term empirical studies on how sustained use of advanced LLM-based research agents (like the Scribe Agent) impacts human researchers' critical thinking, analytical skills, and ability to conduct independent deep dives into literature. The focus is often on efficiency, but the cognitive implications need more rigorous investigation.
2.  **Standardized Benchmarks and Evaluation Metrics for Deep Paper Summarization by AI Agents:** Papers like Singh (5) use metrics like ROUGE, but for the complex task of "deep paper summarization" as envisioned by the Scribe Agent, there's a limited discussion of standardized, human-centric evaluation protocols that go beyond surface-level metrics to assess factual consistency, insight extraction, and nuanced understanding across diverse academic domains.
3.  **Mechanisms for AI Agent Self-Correction and Uncertainty Quantification in Summarization:** While the "Academic Integrity & Verification" section is critical, no papers explicitly detail how a summarization AI agent might *self-correct* its output based on identified inconsistencies or *quantify its uncertainty* about specific claims extracted, beyond simply marking [VERIFY]. This is crucial for building truly trustworthy and autonomous research agents.
4.  **Inter-Agent Feedback Loops for Continuous Improvement in Research Workflows:** Papers discuss multi-agent systems (8, 27, 29) and cooperative learning (18), but there's limited specific work on how feedback from downstream agents (e.g., a "Synthesizer Agent" noticing inconsistencies from the Scribe Agent) can be effectively relayed and utilized by upstream agents (e.g., the Scribe Agent) for continuous improvement in a multi-stage research workflow.
5.  **Practical Implementation and Scalability of Ethical AI Guidelines in Multi-Agent Research Systems:** While numerous papers address AI ethics and governance (11, 13, 16, 22), there's a gap in concrete, documented case studies or architectural patterns for how these ethical guidelines are practically implemented, monitored, and scaled within a complex multi-agent system designed for academic research, particularly concerning bias mitigation in data processing and output generation.
