**Proposed Theoretical Framework: Agentic Value-Based Pricing (AVBP)**
**Length:** 2000-3000 words
This section is adapted from the "Methodology" section of the IMRaD template, focusing on the construction of the theoretical framework.

***Core Principles of AVBP***
-   Define the fundamental tenets of value-based pricing for autonomous agents.
-   Explain how agents move beyond cost/token-centric views to perceive and quantify value.

***Agent Architecture for Value-Based Pricing***
-   **Value Perception Module:** How agents sense and interpret market signals, user needs, and competitive landscapes to infer value.
-   **Value Estimation Engine:** Algorithms and models agents use to quantify perceived value (e.g., utility functions, willingness-to-pay models, predictive analytics).
-   **Pricing Strategy Module:** How agents translate value estimations into concrete pricing decisions (e.g., dynamic optimization, adaptive learning algorithms, game theory approaches).
-   **Market Interaction Interface:** Mechanisms for agents to interact with other agents or human customers, negotiate, and execute transactions.

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2. **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3. **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]
4. **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5. **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
