Okay, Research Scout, I'm ready for my mission! Your request for academic papers and industry reports on AI agent pricing models, token-based pricing for LLMs, usage-based vs. value-based pricing, API pricing strategies, and economic models for AI services is clear.

Given the rapid evolution of AI agents and LLMs, I will prioritize recent publications (2022-2024) but also include highly relevant foundational work from 2019-2021. I will focus on finding 30 high-quality, relevant papers.

Here's my detailed search plan:

**Search Strategy Execution:**

1.  **Understand the Topic:**
    *   **Key Concepts:** AI agent pricing, LLM token pricing, usage-based pricing, value-based pricing, API pricing strategies, economic models for AI services.
    *   **Primary Domains:** Computer Science (AI/ML, Economics of Computing), Business, Economics, Information Systems.
    *   **Date Range:** Primarily 2022-2024, extending to 2019-2021 for highly impactful papers.
    *   **Target Count:** 30 papers.

2.  **Multi-Database Search:**

    *   **Semantic Scholar (Primary):**
        *   Queries:
            *   `"AI agent pricing models"`
            *   `"LLM token pricing economics"`
            *   `"large language model pricing strategies"`
            *   `"usage-based pricing AI services"`
            *   `"value-based pricing AI"`
            *   `"API pricing AI agents"`
            *   `"economic models AI services business"`
            *   `"generative AI monetization"`
        *   Filters: 2019-2024 (prioritizing newer), sorted by relevance and citation count.

    *   **arXiv (Secondary - for recent CS/AI developments):**
        *   Queries (focusing on `cs.AI`, `cs.LG`, `cs.GT`, `econ.GN`):
            *   `"LLM pricing"`
            *   `"AI agent economics"`
            *   `"token pricing large language model"`
            *   `"generative AI business models"`
        *   Filters: 2022-2024, sorted by relevance.

    *   **Google Scholar (Secondary - for broader coverage, including industry reports and less formal academic work):**
        *   Queries (similar to Semantic Scholar, but also looking for whitepapers, reports):
            *   `"AI agent pricing models report"`
            *   `"LLM token pricing industry"`
            *   `"AI service monetization strategies"`
            *   `"economic impact of generative AI pricing"`
        *   Filters: 2019-2024, sorted by relevance. I will carefully vet "industry reports" for credibility and direct relevance to the pricing models.

3.  **Quality Filtering & Ranking:**
    *   I will consolidate results, remove duplicates, and prioritize papers that directly address the economics, pricing, and business models of AI agents and LLMs.
    *   Emphasis on peer-reviewed journals, top conferences, and reputable industry analyses.
    *   Ranking will be based on direct relevance to the specific pricing models requested, impact (citations per year), and recency.
    *   I will ensure each paper includes a `doi` or `arxiv_id` for verification.

***

I will now proceed with the search and compile the results. Please allow a moment for the comprehensive search and synthesis.
