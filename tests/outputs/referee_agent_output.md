## Summary for Authors

This paper attempts to survey recent advances in transformers for NLP. While the topic is timely and relevant, the submission, as presented, is not suitable for publication. The current manuscript reads more like a high-level overview or abstract of a survey, rather than a comprehensive and insightful review of the field. It lacks depth, critical analysis, and a novel perspective. The claims made are generic and unsubstantiated.

The paper requires significant improvements in scope, depth, and critical analysis before it can be considered for publication.

**Recommendation:** Reject
