As an expert Research Scout, I've scoured multiple academic databases using a targeted strategy to find highly relevant papers on AI agent pricing models, token-based pricing for LLMs, usage-based vs. value-based pricing, API pricing strategies, and economic models for AI services.

I focused on papers published between 2019 and 2024, prioritizing those with high relevance, impact (citation count), and credibility. I aimed for a diverse set of papers covering the various facets of your research focus.

Here are 30 highly relevant papers, structured as requested:
