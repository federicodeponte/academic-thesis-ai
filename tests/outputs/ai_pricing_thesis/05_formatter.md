### ⚠️ CITATION REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL

**Specify citation style early and communicate to ALL Crafter agents:**

**Default Style:** APA 7th Edition (unless specified otherwise)

**In-text citation format:**
```
✅ CORRECT: (Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author & Co-Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author et al., Year)

**Language-specific adaptations:**
- German theses: Use German punctuation but keep APA structure
- Spanish/French: Adapt punctuation while maintaining APA format
- Always specify language requirements to Crafter agents

**Communicate to Crafter agents:**
"All citations must follow APA 7th format. Use (Author, Year) in-text. Only add [VERIFY] if you cannot determine the year from research context."

## Formatted Structure

### Title
**Format:** Bold, Centered, 14pt
**Max Length:** 100 characters
**Suggested:** **Beyond Tokens and Costs: A Value-Based Pricing Framework for Autonomous AI Agents**

### Author Information (Typically on a separate Title Page in APA)
**Format:**
- Name(s): Centered, Title Case
- Affiliation(s): Centered, Title Case
- Email(s): Centered, Lowercase
- ORCID: Centered, Hyperlink (Optional)

### Abstract
**Heading:** Bold, Centered (on its own page, no section number)
**Length:** 250-300 words
**Structure:**
- Background (1-2 sentences): The rapid advancement of autonomous AI agents presents unprecedented opportunities but also complex challenges, particularly regarding their economic valuation. Current AI pricing models, primarily based on resource usage (e.g., tokens or computational costs), are proving insufficient.
- Objective (1 sentence): This paper aims to develop a novel value-based pricing framework for autonomous AI agents that accounts for their emergent capabilities, adaptive behavior, and dynamic value creation.
- Methods (2-3 sentences): We propose a multi-dimensional theoretical framework integrating dynamic value assessment, behavioral economics principles, and multi-agent game theory. This framework moves beyond static cost considerations to capture the nuanced and evolving utility generated by agentic AI.
- Results (2-3 sentences): Through illustrative case studies, we demonstrate the applicability of this framework to diverse agentic scenarios, showing its potential to better quantify and communicate the unique value of AI agents compared to traditional approaches.
- Conclusions (1-2 sentences): This value-based framework offers a more robust and sustainable economic foundation for agentic AI, fostering broader market adoption and guiding ethical deployment.

**Keywords:** Autonomous AI, Agentic AI, Value-Based Pricing, AI Economics, Pricing Models, Emergent Value
