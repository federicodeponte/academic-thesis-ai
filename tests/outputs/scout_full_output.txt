üìä Scout Agent Response:

Okay, I'm ready to scout for research sources on "Transformers in natural language processing," focusing on papers from 2020-2024, including foundational papers, and prioritizing highly-cited work.  I will search Semantic Scholar, arXiv, and Google Scholar. Here's the plan:

1. **Search each database** using appropriate queries.
2. **Filter results** to the 2020-2024 timeframe and identify potential foundational papers outside of this range.
3. **Assess relevance, impact (citation count), and source quality.**
4. **Rank the papers** according to the criteria.
5. **Construct the JSON output** including research gaps and suggestions.

Let's begin!

The best performing of these models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism.  We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms.  We show that these models can be trained faster than recurrent or convolutional architectures and achieve superior results on machine translation tasks.",
