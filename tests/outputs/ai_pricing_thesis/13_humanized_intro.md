## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** While refining, preserve all citations and verification markers.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Never remove citations** during editing: *All citations preserved.*
2.  **Preserve [VERIFY] markers** - don't hide uncertainty: *No [VERIFY] markers in original text.*
3.  **Don't add unsupported claims** even if they improve flow: *No new claims added.*
4.  **Maintain DOI/arXiv IDs** in all citations: *N/A for this format, but original citation IDs maintained.*
5.  **Flag if refinements created uncited claims**: *No uncited claims created.*

**Polish the writing, not the evidence. Verification depends on accurate citations.**

## Example Transformations

### Before (AI-typical - excerpt):
"The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in generative AI and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally reshaping industries, business models, and societal interactions {cite_001}{cite_009}. These technologies have transitioned from specialized tools to foundational capabilities, offering unprecedented opportunities for automation, innovation, and value creation across diverse sectors {cite_018}. However, as AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, exhibiting autonomous decision-making and goal-oriented behaviors—often referred to as agentic AI systems—the economic frameworks for their development, deployment, and monetization face significant new challenges {cite_006}{cite_013}."

**Issues:**
-   All sentences long (>25 words).
-   Overuse of formal/AI-common phrases ("rapid advancements," "fundamentally reshaping," "unprecedented opportunities," "significant new challenges").
-   Predictable, formal structure.

### After (Human-like - excerpt):
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving fast. Generative AI and large language models (LLMs), in particular, are fundamentally changing industries, business models, and even how we interact socially {cite_001}{cite_009}. These aren't just specialized tools anymore; they've become foundational capabilities. This shift opens up huge opportunities for automation, innovation, and creating value across many sectors {cite_018}. Yet, as AI systems grow more sophisticated—making autonomous decisions and pursuing specific goals, what we call 'agentic AI'—the economic models for building, deploying, and monetizing them face serious new challenges {cite_006}{cite_013}."

**Improvements:**
-   Varied length (6, 24, 9, 21, 31 words).
-   Replaced AI-common terms ("evolving fast," "fundamentally changing," "huge opportunities," "serious new challenges").
-   Used em-dash for natural pause.
-   More direct, less formulaic language ("aren't just," "what we call").

-   "comprehensive understanding" → "deeply understand"
-   "effective pricing" → "pricing them effectively"
-   "represent a significant evolution" → "mark a real leap past"
-   "conventional AI models" → "conventional AI models" (kept, but context changed)
-   "perform pre-defined tasks" → "just perform pre-defined tasks"
-   "operate autonomously" → "run on their own"
-   "perceive their environment" → "sense their surroundings"
-   "reason about goals" → "think about their goals"
-   "plan sequences of actions" → "map out action plans"
-   "execute those actions to achieve objectives" → "carry them out to hit objectives"
-   "constant human oversight" → "constant human supervision"
-   "leverage advanced capabilities" → "tap into advanced features"

### Structural Variation (14 changes)
-   Broke 6 long sentences into 10 shorter, more varied sentences in the first paragraph.
-   Broke 1 long sentence into 2 shorter, more direct sentences in the second paragraph.
-   Varied sentence openings (e.g., "Artificial intelligence (AI)...", "These aren't just...", "Yet, as AI systems...", "But how they're priced...", "This paper steps in...", "They're not like...").
-   Introduced more simple sentences and rephrased complex ones for clarity.

### Rhythm Improvements (10 changes)
-   Added parenthetical asides ("what we call 'agentic AI'").
-   Used em-dashes for natural pauses and emphasis (e.g., "—the economic models...", "—all without constant human supervision").
-   Introduced more direct and active phrasing to improve flow.
-   Used varied conjunctions (e.g., "Yet," "But," "Instead").

## Anti-AI Detection Techniques Applied

### 1. Removed AI "Tells"
❌ "Additionally, furthermore, moreover, consequently" (none explicitly used, but the overall formal, sequential tone was reduced)
✅ Varied: "Yet," "But," "Instead," and natural flow achieved by rephrasing.

### 2. Added Imperfect Constructions
**AI-typical (too perfect):**
"The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)... are fundamentally reshaping industries..."

**Human-natural:**
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving fast. Generative AI and large language models (LLMs), in particular, are fundamentally changing industries..."
(More direct, less formal opening; conversational "in particular")

### 3. Varied Paragraph Structure
-   The first paragraph now starts with a short, punchy sentence, immediately grabbing attention, rather than a long, formal one.
-   Introduced a question-like phrase ("But how they're priced...") to engage.

### 4. Strategic Informality
**Where appropriate (Introduction):**
-   Colloquialisms: "won't cut it," "hit objectives," "tap into."
-   Directness: "These aren't just specialized tools anymore," "We've mostly focused on what these agents can *do*."

## Content

Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving fast. Generative AI and large language models (LLMs), in particular, are fundamentally changing industries, business models, and even how we interact socially {cite_001}{cite_009}. These aren't just specialized tools anymore; they've become foundational capabilities. This shift opens up huge opportunities for automation, innovation, and creating value across many sectors {cite_018}. Yet, as AI systems grow more sophisticated—making autonomous decisions and pursuing specific goals, what we call 'agentic AI'—the economic models for building, deploying, and monetizing them face serious new challenges {cite_006}{cite_013}. We've mostly focused on what these agents can *do*. But how they're priced, the underlying economic mechanics, remains surprisingly unexplored. Current pricing models for software, or even older AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) offerings, simply won't cut it. They struggle to capture the dynamic value and variable resource use inherent in agentic AI systems {cite_002}{cite_003}. This paper steps in to fill that crucial gap. We aim to deeply understand agentic AI's unique economic traits and propose a working framework for pricing them effectively.

### 1.1. The Rise of Agentic AI Systems

Agentic AI systems mark a real leap past conventional AI models. They're not like static models, which just perform pre-defined tasks from specific inputs. Instead, agentic systems are built to run on their own: they sense their surroundings, think about their goals, map out action plans, and then carry them out to hit objectives—all without constant human supervision {cite_006}. These systems tap into advanced features like natural language understanding, complex reasoning, and memory to interact dy
