## Issues Found

### Tone Inconsistencies

**Issue 1:** Lack of strong confidence in the Discussion
- **Location:** Discussion section
- ❌ "Our findings suggest that transformers will continue to dominate NLP, though efficiency concerns remain."
- ✅ "Our findings indicate that transformers will continue to dominate NLP, although efficiency concerns remain a key area for future research." (More confident and provides direction)

### Person Inconsistencies

**Issue 2:** Consistent person usage needed
- **Location:** Abstract & Conclusion
- **Problem:** Abstract uses third person generally while Conclusion switches back to transformers. It would benefit from framing the impact of the study or work done directly.
- ✅ Abstract: "This paper surveys recent advances in Transformer architectures and highlights key trends identified from 2020-2024"
- ✅ Conclusion: "Our review of Transformer architectures and applications highlights the paradigm shift they represent in NLP, setting a stage for continued research and innovation."

### Tense Inconsistencies

**Issue 3:** Tense in the Results section.
- **Location:** Results section
- ❌ "We identified three major trends: (1) scaling to larger models, (2) efficiency improvements, (3) multimodal integration."
- ✅ "We identified three major trends: (1) scaling to larger models, (2) efficiency improvements, and (3) multimodal integration." (Consistent past tense)
