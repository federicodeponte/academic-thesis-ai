## 1. Major Research Gaps

Given the limited number of papers, these gaps are derived from contrasting the scopes and implications of the two provided summaries.

### Gap 1: Empirical Impact of AI on Foundational Writing Skills & Reflective Practices
**Description:** While AI (Paper 2) offers various writing aids, and journaling (Paper 1) is proven to build foundational writing and critical thinking skills, there's a lack of empirical research investigating how the widespread use of AI writing tools *specifically impacts* students' engagement with and the efficacy of traditional reflective practices like journaling. Do students using AI bypass the reflective process? Does AI enhance or hinder the development of a unique academic voice?
**Why it matters:** Understanding this interaction is crucial for educators to design curricula that effectively integrate AI without compromising the development of essential higher-order thinking and writing skills.
**Evidence:** Paper 1 highlights the benefits of human-centric reflective writing, while Paper 2 discusses AI's role in language education, but neither directly addresses the empirical impact of AI on these foundational, human-driven processes.
**Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium
**Impact potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**How to address:**
- Approach 1: Longitudinal studies comparing writing skill development (including critical thinking and reflective depth) in student cohorts using traditional methods vs. AI-assisted methods.
- Approach 2: Qualitative studies exploring student perceptions and experiences of using AI tools in conjunction with reflective writing tasks.

---

### Gap 2: Designing AI Agents for Reflective Thinking and Metacognition in Academic Writing
**Description:** Paper 2 notes AI's potential for personalized feedback and content generation. However, there's a gap in designing AI agents specifically to *facilitate* or *deepen* reflective thinking and metacognitive processes, rather than just optimizing text generation or correction. Can AI be a "reflection coach" rather than just a "grammar checker"?
**Why it matters:** Moving beyond efficiency to cognitive enhancement could unlock new pedagogical potentials for AI in academic writing.
**Evidence:** Paper 1 emphasizes the development of critical thinking through journaling. Paper 2 lists AI applications but doesn't detail AI designed for *metacognitive scaffolding* in writing.
**Difficulty:** 🔴 High
**Impact potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**How to address:**
- Approach 1: Develop and pilot AI tools that prompt users with reflective questions, analyze the depth of reflection in their writing, or suggest alternative perspectives to encourage critical thinking during the writing process.
- Approach 2: Integrate principles from cognitive science and educational psychology into AI agent design for academic writing.

---

### Gap 3: Ethical Frameworks for AI Use in Developing Foundational Academic Skills
**Description:** Paper 2 touches on ethical concerns (data privacy, bias, hallucination). However, a specific ethical framework is missing for how AI's influence on foundational academic skills (like those developed through journaling, as per Paper 1) should be managed. This includes issues of intellectual ownership, the "deskilling" of students, and equitable access to AI tools for deep learning.
**Why it matters:** Without clear ethical guidelines, the integration of AI could inadvertently exacerbate inequalities or undermine core educational objectives.
**Evidence:** Paper 1 implicitly sets a benchmark for human skill development. Paper 2 raises general ethical concerns but not specifically related to the pedagogical impact on foundational skills.
**Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium
**Impact potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**How to address:**
- Approach 1: Develop a comprehensive ethical framework for AI use in academic writing pedagogy, focusing on preserving and enhancing foundational skills.
- Approach 2: Conduct stakeholder analyses (students, educators, institutions) to understand diverse ethical perceptions regarding AI's role in skill development.
