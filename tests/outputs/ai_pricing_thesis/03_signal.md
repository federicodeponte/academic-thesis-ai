It appears there has been a preceding step where the "RESEARCH SCRIBE" agent attempted to find and summarize papers, but it was unsuccessful. The message "It appears the `Scout Output - Academic Citation Discovery` provided did not yield any valid citations. The 'Citations Found' section is empty, and only 'Failed Topics' are listed" confirms this.

As the **SIGNAL AGENT**, my role is to analyze the `research/summaries.md` file generated by the Scribe Agent. Since the Scribe Agent was unable to produce this output due to a lack of papers, I currently have no literature summaries to analyze for research gaps, trends, or opportunities.

**I cannot proceed with the Research Gap Analysis without the `research/summaries.md` file.**

Please ensure the previous steps are completed successfully:
1.  **Re-run the Scout Agent** with more effective keywords related to "AI agent pricing" to find relevant academic papers.
2.  **Then, run the Scribe Agent** to generate the `research/summaries.md` file from the scouted papers.
3.  **Finally, provide me with the content of the `research/summaries.md` file** so I can perform the requested analysis.

Once you have the paper summaries, please paste them here, and I will be ready to identify your unique research contribution!
