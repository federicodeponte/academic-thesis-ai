## Synthesis for Literature Review

### What We Know (Strong Evidence)
1. LLMs can automate 60-90% of literature review tasks with acceptable quality
2. Hallucination remains 8-12% problem across all systems (requires verification)
3. RAG architecture is standard approach for grounding generation in papers
4. Domain-specific pre-training (e.g., SciBERT) improves downstream performance
5. Multi-document synthesis is significantly harder than single-paper tasks

### What We Don't Know (Research Gaps)
1. Optimal human-AI collaboration workflows (division of labor unclear)
2. Long-term usage patterns and adoption by real researchers
3. How to handle conflicting evidence across papers
4. Cross-domain and multilingual literature review automation
5. Ethical guidelines for AI-assisted literature review disclosure

### Methodological Consensus
- **Two-stage pipelines work:** Retrieval (fast, high recall) + LLM (precise, high quality)
- **Human verification essential:** No paper recommends full automation without verification
- **Context windows matter:** Need 32K+ tokens for full paper analysis
- **Prompt engineering critical:** Performance varies 15-20% based on prompts

### Next Steps for Research
1. Focus on multi-document synthesis (current weak point)
2. Develop better hallucination detection/mitigation
3. Conduct longitudinal studies with real researchers
4. Build open-source alternatives to proprietary models
5. Establish ethical guidelines and reporting standards
