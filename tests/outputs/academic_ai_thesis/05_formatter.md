### ⚠️ CITATION REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL

**Specify citation style early and communicate to ALL Crafter agents:**

**Default Style:** APA 7th Edition (unless specified otherwise)

**In-text citation format:**
```
✅ CORRECT: (Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author & Co-Author, Year)

- **Conclusion:** Present tense (summary of paper, future outlook)

### Voice
- **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active for clarity, passive for objectivity. Strive for a balance.
