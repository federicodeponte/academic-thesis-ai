[Format specifications: Clearly articulate the gap – the lack of a robust theoretical link between OSS and specific SDG outcomes, especially in developing countries. This will set up the need for the framework.]

### 1.3 Research Question and Objectives
**Research Question:** How can a novel theoretical framework elucidate the mechanisms through which Open Source Software (OSS) contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly within developing countries, and what insights do illustrative case studies offer regarding this potential?
**List format:**
1.  To critically review existing literature on Open Source Software's role in developing countries and its connection to sustainable development.
2.  To propose and elaborate a novel theoretical framework that systematically links OSS principles and characteristics to specific SDG targets and outcomes.
3.  To apply this framework through illustrative case studies from developing countries to demonstrate its explanatory power and highlight practical applications.
4.  To discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the framework for understanding and leveraging OSS for global sustainable development.

### 1.4 Contributions
**Bullet format:**
-   **Theoretical Contribution:** Development of a novel, comprehensive theoretical framework explicitly connecting OSS to SDG achievement, bridging a significant gap in current literature.
-   **Methodological Contribution:** Demonstration of a systematic approach to analyzing the developmental impact of technological interventions.
-   **Practical Contribution:** Provision of actionable insights and a structured lens for policymakers, practitioners, and development organizations to strategically leverage OSS for sustainable development initiatives.
-   **Empirical Illustration:** Presentation of illustrative case studies that ground the theoretical framework in real-world contexts, showcasing OSS's transformative capacity.

- ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that..."

### Tense Usage
- **Introduction:** Present tense (current state, problem)
- **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), Present tense (what literature currently shows)
- **Methods (Framework & Methodology):** Past tense (what was done to develop/apply framework), Present tense (describing the framework itself)
- **Results (Framework Application & Findings):** Past tense (what was found in case studies)
- **Discussion:** Present tense (what findings mean, implications)
- **Conclusion:** Present tense (summary, implications)

### Voice
- **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active for clarity, passive for objectivity
- ✅ "We analyzed the data" (active, clear)
- ✅ "The data were analyzed" (passive, objective)

## Next Steps

After formatting:
1. Review against journal guidelines (once a specific journal is verified)
2. Ensure all placeholders are noted (e.g., [VERIFY], [Specific Case Name])
3. Proceed to Compose phase with clear structure
4. Save to `outline_formatted.md`

```

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2. **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3. **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]
4. **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5. **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
