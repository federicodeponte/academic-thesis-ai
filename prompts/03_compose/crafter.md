## Content

[Well-written academic prose with proper formatting]

The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed natural language processing, enabling unprecedented capabilities in text generation, translation, and understanding (Brown et al., 2020; Devlin et al., 2019). Recent applications in healthcare demonstrate particular promise, with systems achieving near-expert performance in medical question answering (Singhal et al., 2023) and diagnostic support (Thirunavukarasu et al., 2023). However, critical challenges remain in ensuring reliability, interpretability, and clinical safety of these systems (Wornow et al., 2023).
