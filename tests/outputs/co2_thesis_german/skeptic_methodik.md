## MAJOR ISSUES (Must Address)

### Issue 1: Overclaim in "Gestaltungsmerkmale" Analysis
**Location:** Section 2.1, para 3 & 4; Section 2.4.1
**Claim:** "Ein systematischer Vergleich dieser Merkmale 칲ber die Fallstudien hinweg wird erm칬glichen, Best Practices zu identifizieren und Empfehlungen f칲r die zuk칲nftige Ausgestaltung von ETS abzuleiten." and "Die Analyse der Wechselwirkungen zwischen den Gestaltungsmerkmalen und den beobachteten Wirkungen ist zentral, um kausale Zusammenh칛nge besser zu verstehen..."
**Problem:** The proposed econometric model ($ETS_{it}$ as a dummy or price) in Section 2.4.1 does not explicitly incorporate *specific design features* (e.g., cap stringency, allocation method, MSR mechanisms) as distinct variables. This creates a significant disconnect between the ambitious claims of analyzing "Gestaltungsmerkmale" and their "Wechselwirkungen" in the analytical framework and the actual detailed methods.
**Evidence:** The model is $E_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ETS_{it} + \beta_2 X_{it} + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{it}$, where $ETS_{it}$ is a dummy or price, not a vector of design features.
**Fix:** Either refine the econometric model to explicitly include and test the impact of specific design features and their interactions (e.g., by creating variables for MSR activation, changes in allocation rules, etc.), or significantly temper the claims about identifying "Best Practices" and understanding "Wechselwirkungen" of design features through quantitative analysis. Acknowledge that the econometric model primarily assesses the *overall effect* or *price effect* of an ETS, while design feature analysis might be more qualitative.
**Severity:** 游댮 High - affects the alignment of research questions with methodology and potential for overclaiming results.

### Issue 2: Lack of Specificity for Econometric Model Variables
**Location:** Section 2.4.1
**Claim:** Model includes $ETS_{it}$ and $\alpha_i$ (feste Effekte f칲r die Einheit $i$).
**Problem:**
1.  **$ETS_{it}$ Variable:** The definition "eine Dummy-Variable... (oder eine Variable f칲r den Zertifikatspreis...)" is vague. These are fundamentally different approaches with distinct implications for interpretation. A dummy only captures presence, while price captures intensity and market dynamics. The paper needs to commit to one, or clearly explain how both will be used and how their results will be reconciled. Using a dummy variable would struggle to capture reforms and evolving stringency.
2.  **"Einheit i":** The term "Einheit i" (unit i) is not clearly defined. Is it individual facilities, specific sectors, or entire countries/regions (e.g., EU as one unit, California as another)? The statement "L칛nder oder Sektoren innerhalb des ETS" is still ambiguous. This choice significantly impacts the number of observations, the degrees of freedom, the interpretation of fixed effects, and the statistical power.
**Fix:**
1.  Clearly state whether the primary ETS effect will be captured by a dummy variable (and how reforms will be handled then) or by the certificate price. Justify this choice.
2.  Explicitly define what "Einheit i" refers to (e.g., "Sektoren auf NACE-2-Ebene innerhalb der EU-Mitgliedstaaten und Kaliforniens").
**Severity:** 游댮 High - fundamental for the clarity, validity, and interpretability of the econometric results.

### Issue 3: Unaddressed Parallel Trends Assumption in DiD
**Location:** Section 2.4.1, para 3
**Claim:** "Zus칛tzlich zur direkten Emissionsreduktion wird die Methode der Differenz-in-Differenzen (DiD)-Analyse angewendet, um die kausale Wirkung des ETS pr칛ziser zu identifizieren."
**Problem:** DiD analysis critically relies on the **parallel trends assumption**, meaning that in the absence of the treatment (ETS), the emissions trends of the treatment group (ETS-covered entities) and the control group (non-ETS entities) would have followed parallel paths. This assumption is not mentioned, discussed, or proposed to be tested.
**Evidence:** No mention of parallel trends assumption.
**Fix:** Explicitly state the parallel trends assumption. Describe how this assumption will be tested (e.g., visual inspection of pre-treatment trends, statistical tests comparing pre-treatment slopes) and what steps will be taken if the assumption is violated (e.g., using synthetic control methods, event studies). Also, concretely identify the proposed control groups for EU ETS and California.
**Severity:** 游댮 High - a critical assumption for the causal interpretation of DiD results; ignoring it undermines validity.

### Issue 4: Data Availability for Economic Efficiency Indicators
**Location:** Section 2.3, "Wirtschaftsdaten" and "Messverfahren"
**Claim:** "Indikatoren wie die 츿nderung der Produktionskosten oder der Gewinnmargen werden, wo Daten verf칲gbar sind, herangezogen."
**Problem:** Data on production costs and profit margins at a granular level (e.g., company or sector-specific within ETS-covered entities) are often proprietary and difficult to obtain from public sources. The phrase "wo Daten verf칲gbar sind" is a significant caveat that suggests these key indicators might not be systematically available, potentially making a comprehensive quantitative analysis of "칬konomische Effizienz" (as defined) challenging or impossible.
**Evidence:** The explicit caveat "wo Daten verf칲gbar sind" for crucial indicators.
**Fix:** Be more transparent about the expected availability of these specific data points. If they are largely unavailable, either propose alternative, more readily available proxies (e.g., energy intensity, investment in specific technologies from public reports, stock market performance of ETS-affected companies) or explicitly state that the quantitative analysis of these specific indicators will be limited/qualitative due to data constraints. Adjust the overall claims about quantifying economic efficiency accordingly.
**Severity:** 游댮 High - impacts the feasibility and transparency of a core analytical dimension.

### Issue 5: Comparability of Emissions Data
**Location:** Section 2.3, "Emissionsdaten"
**Claim:** "Die Konsistenz und Vergleichbarkeit der Emissionsdaten 칲ber die Fallstudien hinweg wird durch die Verwendung standardisierter Reporting-Protokolle sichergestellt."
**Problem:** While there are some international standards, the specific facility-level reporting protocols for the EU ETS (under EU law) and the California Cap-and-Trade Program (under CARB regulations) might have subtle differences in scope, definitions, or methodologies that affect direct comparability, especially for detailed sectoral or facility-level analysis. Claiming "sichergestellt" (ensured) is too strong without further substantiation.
**Evidence:** No specific "standardisierte Reporting-Protokolle" are cited that definitively guarantee cross-system comparability at a granular level.
**Fix:** Acknowledge potential subtle differences in reporting protocols between the two systems. Explain *how* these differences will be identified and, if necessary, harmonized or controlled for in the analysis. If specific international standards *do* apply and ensure comparability, cite them.
**Severity:** 游리 Moderate - impacts the rigor and confidence in cross-case comparisons.

## MODERATE ISSUES (Should Address)

### Issue 6: Vagueness in "Robustheit Testen" for Comparative Analysis
**Location:** Section 2.2, para 4
**Claim:** "Dies erlaubt es, die Robustheit der ETS-Wirkungsmechanismen unter verschiedenen Bedingungen zu testen {cite_048}."
**Problem:** While the selection of diverse case studies is good, the specific *methodology* for "testing the robustness" of ETS mechanisms under different conditions (e.g., supranational vs. subnational, different economic contexts) is not elaborated. It's unclear how the econometric models or qualitative analyses will explicitly perform this "robustness test" beyond simply comparing results.
**Fix:** Briefly describe *how* the comparative analysis will formally assess robustness. This could involve, for instance, performing separate regressions for each system and comparing coefficients, or including interaction terms between ETS effects and context-specific dummy variables if the panel structure allows.

### Issue 7: Insufficient Detail on Carbon Leakage Data
**Location:** Section 2.4.2
**Claim:** "Hierbei wird auch die M칬glichkeit von Carbon Leakage untersucht, indem die Entwicklung von Emissionsintensit칛ten in den ETS-Sektoren im Vergleich zu Nicht-ETS-Sektoren oder internationalen Wettbewerbern analysiert wird {cite_017}."
**Problem:** While a good approach, the data sources for "internationale Wettbewerber" were not explicitly listed in Section 2.3. Analyzing international competitors requires comparable data from non-ETS regions/countries, which is a significant data requirement that needs to be addressed.
**Fix:** Add a brief mention in Section 2.3 about the data sources that will be used for "internationale Wettbewerber" (e.g., Eurostat for non-EU countries, specific national statistics, or international industry databases).

### Issue 8: Clarity on "Secondary" Qualitative Data for Innovation
**Location:** Section 2.3, "Messverfahren" and Section 2.4.3
**Problem:** The phrasing "Hierbei werden auch qualitative Analysen von Unternehmensberichten und Experteninterviews (sekund칛r) herangezogen" (2.3) and "Erfahrungen und Bewertungen von Akteuren aus Wirtschaft und Politik, wie sie in Berichten von Organisationen... dokumentiert sind" (2.4.3) is slightly ambiguous. While "sekund칛r" clarifies no primary interviews, the initial phrasing could be misinterpreted.
**Fix:** Explicitly state upfront that the qualitative analysis relies *solely* on secondary data (literature, policy documents, reports, *reported* expert opinions) and does not involve primary data collection (e.g., new interviews).

### Issue 9: Overstatement of Internal Validity
**Location:** Section 2.4.4
**Claim:** "Die interne Validit칛t der Studie wird durch die sorgf칛ltige Auswahl der 칬konometrischen Modelle, die Kontrolle f칲r St칬rvariablen und die Anwendung von robusten Sch칛tzverfahren gew칛hrleistet."
**Problem:** "Gew칛hrleistet" (ensured/guaranteed) is too strong a claim for any empirical study, especially one dealing with complex policy interventions. Econometric models aim to *enhance* or *improve* internal validity, but rarely "guarantee" it due to potential unobserved confounders or remaining endogeneity.
**Fix:** Soften the language to "Die interne Validit칛t der Studie wird durch... angestrebt" (is aimed to be achieved), or "wird durch... gest칛rkt" (is strengthened by), or "wird durch... adressiert" (is addressed by).

---

## MINOR ISSUES

1.  **Generic Theoretical Underpinnings:** "Der theoretische Unterbau dieses Analyserahmens speist sich aus der Umwelt칬konomie, insbesondere der Theorie der externen Effekte und marktbasierter Instrumente." (2.1) Could be slightly more specific by naming specific economic models or concepts (e.g., Pigouvian taxes, Coase Theorem, permit market design theory) if applicable, to show deeper theoretical engagement.
2.  **"Am l칛ngsten etablierten" Overclaim:** For case studies (2.2), "Diese Systeme repr칛sentieren zwei der gr칬릆en und am l칛ngsten etablierten Emissionshandelssysteme weltweit..." is a slight overclaim. While very mature, there might be older, smaller, or national systems. Better to say "zwei der gr칬릆en und bedeutendsten etablierten multisektoralen Systeme" or "zwei der am l칛ngsten etablierten gro른n Systeme."
3.  **Specificity of Interpolation Methods:** "Fehlende Datenpunkte werden, wo angemessen, durch Interpolation oder andere statistische Verfahren behandelt, wobei die Grenzen dieser Methoden transparent gemacht werden." (2.3) While stating limits is good, briefly mentioning *which* interpolation methods (e.g., linear, spline, Last Observation Carried Forward) are considered and under what criteria "angemessen" is defined would enhance transparency.
4.  **Lack of Alternative Econometric Estimators:** While Fixed Effects are appropriate, briefly mentioning that other estimators (e.g., Random Effects with Hausman test, or GMM for dynamic panels if lagged dependent variables are considered) were *considered* and why Fixed Effects were chosen as primary would demonstrate broader methodological awareness.

## Logical Gaps

### Gap 1: Disconnect between Design Feature Ambition and Method
**Location:** Section 2.1 vs. 2.4.1
**Logic:** The paper sets an ambitious goal to analyze the *influence* and *interactions* of specific ETS "Gestaltungsmerkmale" (design features) to identify best practices. However, the econometric model presented for effectiveness analysis does not explicitly operationalize these specific features as variables.
**Missing:** A clear logical bridge explaining how the proposed quantitative methods will *actually* analyze the nuances of "Gestaltungsmerkmale" beyond the mere presence or price of an ETS.
**Fix:** As per Major Issue 1, either align the method with the ambition or temper the ambition.

---

## Methodological Concerns

### Concern 1: Unaddressed Endogeneity Beyond Fixed Effects
**Issue:** While fixed effects help control for time-invariant unobservables, the econometric models (2.4.1, 2.4.2) do not discuss potential *time-varying* endogeneity issues (e.g., reverse causality between ETS prices and emissions/economic variables, or omitted time-varying variables). This is particularly relevant when using certificate prices as an explanatory variable, as prices themselves are endogenous outcomes of market dynamics and policy expectations.
**Risk:** Causal claims might be biased if such endogeneity is not addressed.
**Reviewer Question:** "How do you plan to address potential endogeneity concerns beyond fixed effects, especially regarding the relationship between ETS prices and emissions/economic outcomes?"
**Suggestion:** Briefly discuss potential sources of time-varying endogeneity and outline strategies to mitigate them (e.g., using instrumental variables if feasible, lagged variables, or explicitly acknowledging as a limitation).

### Concern 2: Ambiguity of "Einheit i" for Panel Data
**Issue:** As highlighted in Major Issue 2, the precise definition of "Einheit i" for the panel data analysis remains ambiguous. This is not just a clarity issue but a fundamental methodological choice affecting the entire panel structure and interpretation.
**Risk:** Misinterpretation of fixed effects, incorrect degrees of freedom, and unclear scope of findings.
**Reviewer Question:** "Please specify what constitutes 'Einheit i' in your panel data analysis (e.g., specific industrial sectors, individual facilities, or regional aggregations)."
**Suggestion:** Clearly define "Einheit i" and justify the choice in terms of data availability and research questions.

## Missing Discussions

1.  **Specific Control Groups for DiD:** While DiD is proposed, concrete examples or criteria for selecting the actual control group(s) for both the EU ETS and California program are missing.
2.  **Handling of ETS Reforms:** The EU ETS, in particular, has undergone significant reforms (e.g., MSR introduction). The methodology should explicitly state how these reforms will be integrated into the econometric models (especially if using a simple ETS dummy) or how their impact will be qualitatively assessed.
3.  **Data Limitations for Innovation:** A more explicit and detailed discussion of the inherent difficulties in *quantitatively* attributing innovation to ETS and the limitations of proxy measures (patents, R&D investment) would strengthen transparency.
4.  **Sensitivity to Data Quality:** While data checks are mentioned, a brief discussion of how critical outliers, missing values (beyond interpolation), or potential inaccuracies in publicly available datasets (especially for emissions and prices, which can be subject to reporting errors or market manipulation) might be handled or acknowledged as limitations.

---

## Tone & Presentation Issues

1.  **Overly Confident Language:** As noted in Major Issue 9 and Moderate Issue 4, phrases like "gew칛hrleistet" (ensured) for internal validity are too strong. Academic writing generally requires a more cautious and nuanced tone, acknowledging inherent limitations.

---

## Questions a Reviewer Will Ask

1.  "What are the specific 'units i' (e.g., sectors, countries, facilities) in your panel data analysis, and how does this choice impact your number of observations and the interpretation of your fixed effects?"
2.  "How will you test or justify the critical parallel trends assumption for your Difference-in-Differences analysis, and what are your proposed control groups for both the EU ETS and California?"
3.  "Given your ambition to analyze 'Gestaltungsmerkmale,' how will your econometric models explicitly account for specific ETS design features (e.g., cap stringency, allocation methods, MSR) beyond a simple dummy or price variable?"
4.  "Considering the likely difficulty in obtaining granular data on production costs or profit margins, how will you ensure a robust and quantitative analysis of the '칬konomische Effizienz' dimension, or will this aspect be primarily qualitative?"
5.  "How do you plan to address potential endogeneity concerns beyond fixed effects, especially regarding the relationship between ETS prices and emissions/economic outcomes, and what are the limitations of your approach?"
6.  "How will you integrate the significant reforms and evolution of the EU ETS (e.g., MSR, phase changes) into your econometric models?"
7.  "What specific 'standardisierte Reporting-Protokolle' ensure the comparability of emissions data between the EU ETS and California Cap-and-Trade, or how will you address potential differences?"
