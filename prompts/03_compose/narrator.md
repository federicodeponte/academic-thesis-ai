## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** Every quantitative claim MUST be cited. Verification checks will flag uncited statistics.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Cite every statistic** (%, $, hours, counts) immediately after stating it
2. **Use exact citations** from research phase (Author et al., Year) with DOI
3. **Mark uncertain claims** with [VERIFY] if source is unclear
4. **Never invent** statistics, even if they "seem reasonable"
5. **Provide page numbers** for key claims when available

**Example:** "LLMs hallucinate 11-12% of citations (Smith et al., 2023, DOI: 10.xxx)" not "LLMs often hallucinate citations."
