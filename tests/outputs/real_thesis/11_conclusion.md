The rise of agentic AI systems represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, offering unprecedented capabilities in automating complex tasks and creating novel economic opportunities. This paper addressed a critical gap in the existing literature by proposing a value-based pricing framework tailored to the unique characteristics of these advanced AI agents. While token-based pricing models dominate the current landscape, they fundamentally fail to capture the multifaceted value generated by agentic systems, leading to suboptimal resource allocation and hindered adoption (Anderson & Lee, 2020; Smith, 2022).

Our analysis, grounded in economic theories of value creation and pricing (e.g., Lancaster's characteristics theory, 1966; Varian's microeconomic analysis, 1992), demonstrated that value in agentic AI extends beyond computational cost and encompasses dimensions such as improved decision-making, enhanced productivity, reduced risk, and creation of new services (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014; Goldfarb et al., 2019). By aligning pricing with these value drivers, businesses can more effectively monetize their AI investments, while users gain access to solutions that are both economically justifiable and strategically beneficial. The proposed framework allows for a nuanced understanding of how different features and functionalities of agentic AI contribute to overall value, providing a roadmap for designing pricing strategies that reflect the true worth of these systems.

In summary, this research introduced a novel perspective on pricing agentic AI systems, moving beyond simplistic cost-plus models towards a value-centric approach. By focusing on the economic benefits delivered by these systems, rather than just their computational requirements, we provide a foundation for sustainable growth and widespread adoption of agentic AI across various industries (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2018; Agrawal et al., 2019). The integration of economic principles with advanced AI technologies offers a powerful synergy that can unlock significant value for both developers and users.

However, this study is not without its limitations. The theoretical nature of the framework necessitates further empirical validation through real-world case studies and quantitative analyses. Future research should explore the practical implementation of value-based pricing in diverse business contexts, considering factors such as market dynamics, competitive landscape, and user preferences (Porter, 1985; Shapiro & Varian, 1998). Additionally, investigating the ethical implications of value-based pricing, particularly in relation to accessibility and affordability of AI-driven solutions, is crucial to ensure equitable distribution of the benefits offered by agentic AI (O'Neil, 2016). Subsequent work should also address the challenges of accurately measuring and quantifying the value generated by these complex systems, potentially leveraging advanced analytical techniques and behavioral economics insights.

Despite these limitations, this paper makes a significant contribution to the emerging field of AI economics, offering a new lens through which to view the pricing and valuation of agentic AI systems. By emphasizing the importance of aligning pricing with value creation, we provide a pathway for unlocking the full economic potential of these transformative technologies, paving the way for a future where AI agents seamlessly integrate into businesses and societies, creating sustainable value for all stakeholders. The journey beyond tokens is just beginning.
