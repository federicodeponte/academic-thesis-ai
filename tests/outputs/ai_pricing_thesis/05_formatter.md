### Section Heading Levels (APA 7th Edition)
- **Level 1 (Main Sections):** Centered, Bold, Title Case (e.g., **Abstract**)
- **Level 2 (Subsections):** Flush Left, Bold, Title Case (e.g., **1.1 Background and Motivation**)
- **Level 3 (Further Subsections):** Flush Left, Bold, Italic, Title Case (e.g., *1.1.1 Historical Context*)
- **Level 4 (Further Subsections):** Indented, Bold, Title Case, ending with a period. Text begins on the same line (e.g., **1.1.1.1 Prior research.** Text here.)
- **Level 5 (Further Subsections):** Indented, Bold, Italic, Title Case, ending with a period. Text begins on the same line (e.g., *1.1.1.1.1 Specific findings.* Text here.)

### Citation Format
- **In-text:** (Author, Year) or Author (Year)
- **Bibliography:** Full format specification for APA 7th Edition (e.g., Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). *Title of work*. Publisher. DOI/URL)

### ⚠️ CITATION REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL

**Specify citation style early and communicate to ALL Crafter agents:**

**Default Style:** APA 7th Edition (unless specified otherwise)

**In-text citation format:**
```
✅ CORRECT: (Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author & Co-Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author et al., Year)
❌ WRONG: (Author [VERIFY]) - missing year
```

**Reference list requirements:**
- Use DOI when available: `https://doi.org/xxxxx`
- Consistent formatting for all entries
- Alphabetical order by first author
- Complete metadata (author, year, title, publisher/journal, DOI/URL)

**For table notes and data sources:**
```
✅ CORRECT: *Note.* Adapted from Author (Year) and Organization (Year).
❌ WRONG: *Source: Author (Year) [VERIFY].*
```

**[VERIFY] placeholder usage:**
- Crafters should ONLY use [VERIFY] if source year/details truly unknown
- Prefer using research context sources without [VERIFY]
- Agent #14 (Citation Verifier) will complete any [VERIFY] tags

**Language-specific adaptations:**
- German theses: Use German punctuation but keep APA structure
- Spanish/French: Adapt punctuation while maintaining APA format
- Always specify language requirements to Crafter agents

**Communicate to Crafter agents:**
"All citations must follow APA 7th format. Use (Author, Year) in-text. Only add [VERIFY] if you cannot determine the year from research context."

### Tense Usage
- **Introduction:** Present tense (current state, purpose of paper)
- **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), Present tense (current understanding/theories)
- **Proposed Framework:** Present tense (describing the framework), Future tense (for expected outcomes/applications)
- **Case Study Applications:** Past tense (describing the application steps), Present tense (interpreting the results of the application)
- **Discussion:** Present tense (what it means, implications), Past tense (referring to own findings)
- **Conclusion:** Present tense (summarizing, stating implications)

### Voice
- **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active for clarity, passive for objectivity

## Next Steps

After formatting:
1. Review against journal guidelines (once a specific journal is identified)
2. Ensure all placeholders are noted
3. Proceed to Compose phase with clear structure
4. Save to `outline_formatted.md`

```

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2. **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3. **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]
4. **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5. **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
