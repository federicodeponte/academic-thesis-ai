```markdown
# Paper Architecture

**Paper Type:** Theoretical analysis with case studies
**Research Question:** How can we design effective and equitable pricing models for Agentic AI systems that move beyond token-based approaches and better reflect value creation?
**Target Venue:**  [To be determined based on scope and depth, but possibilities include journals focused on AI Ethics, Economics of AI, or specialized AI agent publications]
**Estimated Length:** 8,000-10,000 words

## Core Argument Flow

**Thesis Statement:**  Token-based pricing models for Agentic AI systems are insufficient for capturing the nuanced value creation of these systems.  Value-based pricing, informed by economic theory and demonstrated through relevant case studies, offers a more effective and equitable approach to aligning incentives, fostering innovation, and promoting wider adoption.

**Logical Progression:**
1. Agentic AI systems are emerging and present unique pricing challenges (Introduction)
2. Current token-based models are limited in reflecting true value (Literature Review: Token-based models and their limitations)
3. Value-based pricing, drawing on economic principles, offers a more appropriate framework (Theoretical Framework: Value-based pricing)
4. Case studies demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of value-based models in different Agentic AI applications (Case Studies)
5.  Value-based pricing promotes fairness and innovation while addressing limitations and future research (Discussion)
