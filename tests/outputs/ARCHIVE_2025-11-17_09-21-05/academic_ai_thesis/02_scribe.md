As the Research Scribe Agent, I am ready to deep-dive into academic papers and extract their core insights.

However, the input you've provided, titled "Scout Output - Academic Citation Discovery," indicates "Total Valid Citations: 44" but does not actually include the list of these 44 citations or their details (titles, authors, DOIs, arXiv IDs, etc.). It only lists "Failed Topics" and shows 0 citations from specific sources.

My task explicitly requires "Given a list of papers from the Scout Agent, you will: 1. Read abstracts and full papers... 2. Extract key information..."

**I cannot proceed with the summarization task without the actual list of papers/citations.**

Please provide the `research/sources.md` file (or equivalent list of paper details) that the Scout Agent was supposed to generate, containing the titles, authors, DOIs, arXiv IDs, or other identifiers for the 44 valid citations it found. Once I have that, I can begin the deep-reading and summarization process according to the specified framework and output format.
