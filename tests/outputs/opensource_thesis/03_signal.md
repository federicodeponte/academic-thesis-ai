## 1. Major Research Gaps

### Gap 1: Lack of Comprehensive, Empirically Validated Sustainability Frameworks
**Description:** Numerous papers call for comprehensive frameworks and models for OSS sustainability, encompassing its various dimensions (technical, economic, social, security, ethical). While individual aspects are studied (e.g., governance, business models, security), a unifying, testable framework is missing. Many proposed models also lack rigorous empirical validation.
**Why it matters:** Without a robust framework, researchers and practitioners lack a common language and structured approach to assess, manage, and improve the long-term viability of OSS projects. Empirical validation is crucial to ensure theoretical constructs hold in real-world scenarios.
**Evidence:** Papers 2, 4, 9, 12, 16, 28 all explicitly or implicitly highlight the need for more empirical studies and/or comprehensive frameworks. Jie (2023) calls for comprehensive frameworks, Raman (2023) for empirical validation of governance models, Wang (2023) and Dey (2022) for empirical evidence on business model effectiveness. Nowacki (2021) (in a related field) identifies a conceptual framework gap.
**Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium
**Impact potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**How to address:**
- Approach 1: Synthesize existing theoretical contributions across various sustainability dimensions into a multi-dimensional framework.
- Approach 2: Design and conduct mixed-methods studies (e.g., surveys, case studies, quantitative analysis of project data) to empirically validate proposed frameworks or specific components.

### Gap 2: Under-Explored Long-Term Sustainability in Developing Countries
**Description:** While early work (Okoli, 2009) identified a scarcity of research on long-term sustainability of OSS in developing countries, and recent papers (Alhassan, 2023; Mohamed, 2023; Almarri, 2022) address adoption factors, there's still a significant lack of longitudinal studies tracking the actual long-term impact, challenges, and evolution of OSS projects and ecosystems within these specific contexts.
**Why it matters:** Developing countries often face unique infrastructural, policy, cultural, and economic challenges that profoundly impact OSS sustainability. Short-term adoption studies do not capture the complexities of maintaining and evolving OSS over extended periods in these regions.
**Evidence:** Paper 1 (Okoli, 2009) explicitly states a "notable scarcity of research concerning the long-term sustainability of OSS projects specifically within developing countries." Papers 3, 7, 15 focus on adoption, but their summaries do not indicate long-term follow-up. Paper 11 (Shen, 2023) generally calls for long-term empirical studies.
**Difficulty:** 🔴 High
**Impact potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**How to address:**
- Approach 1: Conduct longitudinal case studies of specific OSS projects or initiatives within developing countries, tracking their evolution, challenges, and success factors over several years.
- Approach 2: Develop and apply context-specific metrics for sustainability tailored to the unique conditions of developing countries.

---

### Gap 3: Methodological Gap in Policy Impact Assessment
**Description:** The role and effectiveness of government policies in promoting or hindering OSS adoption and growth, especially in developing countries, remain largely underexplored with rigorous methodological approaches. Studies often identify policy as a factor but rarely quantify or deeply analyze its causal impact.
**Why it matters:** Government policies (e.g., procurement mandates, funding for FOSS centers, legal frameworks for licensing) can significantly shape the environment for OSS. Understanding their precise impact is crucial for evidence-based policymaking to foster sustainable OSS ecosystems.
**Evidence:** Paper 1 (Okoli, 2009) identified a "lack of studies investigating the role and effectiveness of government policies." Paper 7 (Mohamed, 2023) mentions policy as a factor in adoption but doesn't detail a deep policy impact assessment.
**Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium
**Impact potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**How to address:**
- Approach 1: Employ comparative case studies of countries with differing OSS policies to analyze outcomes.
- Approach 2: Utilize quasi-experimental designs (e.g., difference-in-differences) to evaluate the impact of specific policy interventions where data allows.

---

### Gap 4: Integration of Emerging Technologies (e.g., AI/ML) and OSS Sustainability
**Description:** While some papers (Kaur, 2023; Salo, 2023) begin to address sustainability challenges in AI/ML OSS, there's a broader gap in understanding how the unique characteristics of AI/ML development (e.g., data dependency, model lifecycle, ethical implications, computational costs) interact with and impact the long-term sustainability of open-source projects.
**Why it matters:** AI/ML is a rapidly growing field, with many foundational tools and libraries being open source. The specific challenges of AI/ML (e.g., data drift, model explainability, ethical bias, resource intensity) introduce new dimensions to OSS sustainability that require dedicated research.
**Evidence:** Paper 5 (Kaur, 2023) focuses on AI/ML OSS sustainability challenges. Paper 10 (Salo, 2023) addresses AI ethics and sustainability in OSS. However, these are early explorations, indicating an emerging but not yet fully covered area.
**Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium
**Impact potential:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**How to address:**
- Approach 1: Conduct in-depth case studies of successful and failing open-source AI/ML projects to identify specific sustainability factors.
- Approach 2: Develop a specialized sustainability framework or set of metrics tailored for open-source AI/ML projects, considering data, model, and ethical lifecycles.

### Gap 5: Lack of Clear Guidelines and Metrics for Sustainable Software Engineering (SSE) in OSS
**Description:** While the concept of Sustainable Software Engineering (SSE) is gaining traction, and OSS is seen as a natural fit (Lundell, 2023), there is a noted absence of clear, actionable guidelines and specific metrics for applying SSE principles within the unique context of open-source development.
**Why it matters:** SSE aims to reduce the environmental and social impact of software. Without specific guidelines and metrics for OSS, projects may struggle to implement SSE effectively, missing opportunities for broader societal impact.
**Evidence:** Paper 6 (Lundell, 2023) explicitly states a "lack of clear guidelines/metrics for applying SSE to OSS."
**Difficulty:** 🟢 Low
**Impact potential:** ⭐⭐⭐

**How to address:**
- Approach 1: Develop a set of best practices and guidelines for integrating SSE principles into OSS development workflows.
- Approach 2: Propose and validate specific metrics to measure the environmental and social sustainability of OSS projects (e.g., energy consumption of build processes, accessibility features).

## 7. Temporal Gaps

### Recent Developments Not Yet Studied
1.  **Impact of Generative AI Tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) on OSS Sustainability:** These tools have rapidly changed development practices since 2022-2023. Their effects on code quality, technical debt, developer skill development, and community dynamics in OSS are largely unstudied from a sustainability perspective.
2.  **Post-Pandemic Shifts in OSS Collaboration and Community Health:** The global pandemic (2020-2022) significantly altered remote work and collaboration. Its long-term effects on OSS community engagement, burnout, and project longevity are still emerging and warrant study.
3.  **Evolving Regulatory Landscape (e.g., EU Cyber Resilience Act):** New regulations specifically targeting software supply chain security (many of which involve OSS) are coming into effect. Their practical implications for OSS project sustainability, legal compliance, and developer burden are a significant temporal gap.

### Outdated Assumptions
1.  **Assumption from 2009 (Okoli, 2009):** While foundational, the assumption that research on long-term sustainability and policy in DCs is scarce may still hold, but the *nature* of the challenges and opportunities has undoubtedly evolved with increased internet penetration and digital transformation in these regions.
2.  **Tech limitation:** Early papers might have focused on a simpler OSS ecosystem. The current complexity of dependencies, cloud-native development, and microservices introduces new sustainability challenges not fully considered in older literature.
