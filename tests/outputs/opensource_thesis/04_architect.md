## Core Argument Flow

**Thesis Statement:** Despite its recognized potential, the precise mechanisms by which Open Source Software (OSS) contributes to global development, particularly in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within developing countries, remain under-theorized and under-researched in contemporary literature; this paper proposes and illustrates a novel theoretical framework to bridge this gap, demonstrating OSS's transformative capacity.

**Logical Progression:**
1.  Global challenges (e.g., SDGs) demand innovative solutions, and OSS is often cited as a powerful tool (Introduction).
2.  Existing literature on OSS in developing countries is dated, and a robust theoretical link between OSS and specific SDG outcomes is missing (Literature Review & Gap).
3.  We propose a novel theoretical framework that systematically connects OSS principles and characteristics to tangible SDG contributions (Theoretical Framework).
4.  Illustrative case studies from developing countries demonstrate the framework's explanatory power and highlight practical applications of OSS for SDG achievement (Case Studies & Analysis).
5.  This framework advances our understanding of OSS's developmental impact, offers practical guidance, and underscores its "world-saving" potential (Discussion).
