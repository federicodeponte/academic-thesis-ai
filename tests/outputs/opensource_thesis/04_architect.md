## Writing Priorities

**Must be crystal clear:**
-   The proposed OSS-GI theoretical framework and its components.
-   How the case studies illustrate the framework and highlight measurement challenges.
-   The specific contributions of the paper to theory and practice.

**Can be concise:**
-   Detailed history of individual OSS projects (unless directly relevant to a mechanism).
-   Extensive technical details of software (unless crucial for understanding impact).

**Should be compelling:**
-   Introduction hook and problem statement, emphasizing the urgency of global challenges.
-   Discussion of implications, making a strong case for OSS's "world-saving" potential.
-   Conclusion's call to action for future research and policy.

## Section Dependencies

Write in this order:
1.  **Theoretical Framework** (Establish your core argument/model first)
2.  **Case Study Methodology** (Define how you'll apply the framework)
3.  **Case Study Findings** (Apply the framework, gather evidence)
4.  **Literature Review** (Now you know what theoretical/empirical context your framework and findings fit into)
5.  **Introduction** (You know exactly what you're introducing and why)
6.  **Discussion** (Interpret findings in light of framework, literature, and gaps)
7.  **Conclusion** (Summarize everything effectively)
8.  **Abstract** (Last - condenses the entire paper)

## Quality Checks

Each section should answer:
-   **Introduction:** Why should I care about OSS's global impact, and what specific problem does this paper solve?
-   **Literature Review:** What do we already know about OSS's impact, and what crucial gaps remain, especially regarding sustainability metrics and governance?
-   **Theoretical Framework:** What is our new conceptual model for understanding OSS's global impact, and how does it connect mechanisms to outcomes?
-   **Case Study Methodology:** How did we select and analyze real-world examples to illustrate the framework?
-   **Case Study Findings:** What did we observe in the case studies that exemplify the framework and highlight measurement challenges?
-   **Discussion:** What do these findings mean for our understanding of OSS's global impact, how do they relate to existing knowledge, and what are the theoretical and practical implications?
-   **Conclusion:** What are the key takeaways, what did we contribute, and what are the most important next steps for research and action?

## Target Audience Considerations

**For this paper, assume readers:**
-   Know: Basic concepts of open source software, general understanding of global challenges (SDGs, climate change).
-   Don't know: The specific theoretical linkages between OSS mechanisms and multi-dimensional global impact, the current state of granular impact measurement for OSS, or effective governance models for maximizing this impact.
-   Care about: Practical applications of OSS for societal benefit, evidence-based policy making, innovative solutions to global problems, and rigorous academic inquiry.

**Therefore:**
-   Explain: The nuances of the OSS-GI framework, the specific mechanisms, and the challenges in measurement.
-   Assume: Familiarity with terms like "open source," "collaboration," "sustainability" at a conceptual level.
-   Emphasize: The novel theoretical contribution, the real-world relevance of the case studies, and the actionable recommendations for future research and policy.

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines - *All specific paper references are marked with [VERIFY] as placeholders, indicating user responsibility.*
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics - *All examples are generic or well-known and require user to fill with real data.*
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO] - *Done.*
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments - *The structure explicitly calls for evidence in findings and discussion sections.*
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support - *The Lit Review, Theoretical Framework, and Discussion sections are inherently citation-heavy.*
