## Systematic Review Standards Compliance

**Review Date:** 2025-10-30
**Standard:** PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)

## METHODOLOGY CLAIMS

**Paper States:**
> "We conducted a systematic literature review following established protocols."

**Let's verify this claim.**

### 2. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria? ✅ YES
- Clear criteria provided
- Appropriate for topic
- **Score:** 5/5

---

### 3. Selection Process Transparent? ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **States:** 156 → 42 → 10 papers
- **Missing:** How were 42 selected from 156? What criteria? ❌
- **Missing:** Why these 10 for deep analysis? ❌

**Score:** 2/5

---

### 4. Quality Assessment? ❌ NO

## SYSTEMATIC VS. NARRATIVE REVIEW

**Question:** Is this actually a "systematic review"?

**Systematic Review Requirements:**
1. Pre-specified protocol ❌
2. Exhaustive search ⚠️ (Possible)
3. Explicit selection criteria ✅
4. Quality assessment ❌
5. Systematic data extraction ❌
6. Synthesis methodology ⚠️

**Verdict:** ❌ **NOT a true systematic review**
- More accurately: "Scoping review" or "Literature review"
- Claiming "systematic" is MISLEADING

---

## SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION

**Claims:** 42 papers found, 10 deeply analyzed

**Issues:**
1. ❓ Why 10? No justification
2. ❓ How were they selected? Not explained
3. ❓ Is 10 sufficient? No power analysis
4. ⚠️ Potential selection bias

**Score:** 2/10 (No justification)

---

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

**Pass/Fail:** ❌ **FAIL** (as "systematic review")
**Alternative:** ⚠️ **PASS** (as "literature review")

**The problem:** Paper CLAIMS to be systematic but ISN'T

**Professor's Assessment:**
> "This is a literature review, not a systematic review. The terminology is misleading. Either conduct a proper systematic review (with PRISMA compliance) or call it what it is: a narrative literature review."

---

## GRADE IMPACT

**Methodology Rigor Score:** D (40/100)

**Reasoning:**
- Decent for a narrative review (C+)
- Inadequate for a systematic review (F)
- **Misleading terminology reduces grade to D**

---

**Phase 4 Complete: Methodology Assessment**
**Result:** ❌ FAIL (Methodology misrepresented)
