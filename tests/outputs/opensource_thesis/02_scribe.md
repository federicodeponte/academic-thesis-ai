### Contradictions or Debates
-   **Commercialization vs. Community Ethos:** While papers like Riehle (29) and "Impact of OSS on Entrepreneurship" (48) highlight the viability of commercial open-source models, there's an inherent tension with the "gift economy" (Marthaller 12) and "new commons" (Bollier 37) ethos. The debate often revolves around how much commercial involvement can occur before it undermines the volunteer spirit or leads to "enclosure" of the commons.
-   **Lock-in vs. Freedom:** Zhu & Zhou (30) discuss how OSS mitigates proprietary lock-in, yet acknowledge that even open source can create "soft lock-in" through network effects or ecosystem dependencies. This suggests that while open source offers greater freedom, complete absence of lock-in is a complex ideal.
-   **Open Source as Peer Review:** Willighagen (14) explicitly argues that "Open Source != peer review," challenging a common perception. While open source involves continuous scrutiny, it lacks the formal, structured, and often anonymous validation of academic peer review, highlighting different quality assurance mechanisms.
