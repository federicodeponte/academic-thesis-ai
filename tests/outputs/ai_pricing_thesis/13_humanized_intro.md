## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** While refining, preserve all citations and verification markers.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Never remove citations** during editing: **All citations preserved.**
2.  **Preserve [VERIFY] markers** - don't hide uncertainty: **`{cite_MISSING: General reference on agentic AI capabilities}` preserved.**
3.  **Don't add unsupported claims** even if they improve flow: **No new claims added.**
4.  **Maintain DOI/arXiv IDs** in all citations: **Citation format maintained.**
5.  **Flag if refinements created uncited claims**: **No uncited claims created.**

**Polish the writing, not the evidence. Verification depends on accurate citations.**

## Example Transformations

### Before (AI-typical):
"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the domain of large language models (LLMs) and their subsequent evolution into autonomous, agentic systems, marks a pivotal moment in technological and economic history {cite_001}{cite_004}. These sophisticated AI agents are no longer mere tools for automation or data analysis; they are increasingly capable of independent decision-making, goal-oriented action, and complex interaction with dynamic environments {cite_MISSING: General reference on agentic AI capabilities}."

**Issues:**
- Long, uniformly structured sentences.
- Overuse of formal, somewhat generic academic phrases ("rapid advancement," "subsequent evolution," "pivotal moment," "increasingly capable").
- Predictable SVO structure.

### After (Human-like):
"The quick rise of artificial intelligence (AI)—especially large language models (LLMs) evolving into autonomous, agentic systems—marks a pivotal moment in technological and economic history {cite_001}{cite_004}. No longer mere tools for automation or data analysis, these sophisticated AI agents can now make independent decisions, pursue specific goals, and interact complexly with dynamic environments {cite_MISSING: General reference on agentic AI capabilities}."

**Improvements:**
- Varied sentence openings (e.g., starting with an inverted clause "No longer mere tools...").
- Added em-dashes for natural pauses and parenthetical asides.
- Replaced some AI-common terms ("rapid advancement" → "quick rise," "increasingly capable of" → "can now make").
- Slightly shorter average sentence length with more dynamic phrasing.

## Anti-AI Detection Techniques Applied

### 1. Removed AI "Tells"
❌ "However" (replaced with "Yet" for variety)
✅ Varied: "Yet," "No longer...", "What constitutes...?" for more natural transitions and flow.

### 2. Added Imperfect Constructions
**AI-typical (too perfect):**
"The fundamental questions of what constitutes value, how to attribute it, and how to monetize it fairly and sustainably in an agentic AI ecosystem remain largely unanswered..."

**Human-natural:**
"What constitutes value? How do we attribute it? And how can we monetize it fairly and sustainably within an agentic AI ecosystem? These fundamental questions largely remain unanswered..."
(The use of direct questions breaks the rigid academic structure, making it feel more like a human posing a problem).

### 3. Varied Paragraph Structure
- The paragraph now includes a series of questions, diverging from a purely declarative, topic-sentence-driven structure.
- The ending of the first paragraph, after the questions, provides a clear statement of the paper's purpose, creating a natural narrative arc.

### 4. Strategic Informality
- While maintaining an academic tone, the direct questions introduce a subtle, engaging directness without becoming overly casual.

## Content (Entropy Agent Refined)

The quick rise of artificial intelligence (AI)—especially large language models (LLMs) evolving into autonomous, agentic systems—marks a pivotal moment in technological and economic history {cite_001}{cite_004}. No longer mere tools for automation or data analysis, these sophisticated AI agents can now make independent decisions, pursue specific goals, and interact complexly with dynamic environments {cite_MISSING: General reference on agentic AI capabilities}. This shift from passive AI models to active, agentic entities opens up new opportunities for creating value across nearly every industry, spanning personalized healthcare, automated financial trading, and intelligent manufacturing {cite_003}{cite_020}. Yet, with these transformative potentials comes a new, complex challenge: how do we effectively price the services and capabilities these autonomous systems offer? {cite_005}{cite_008} Traditional economic frameworks and existing pricing strategies—mostly designed for tangible goods or static digital services—often fall short. They struggle when faced with the dynamic, opaque, and frequently unpredictable nature of agentic AI outputs. What constitutes value? How do we attribute it? And how can we monetize it fairly and sustainably within an agentic AI ecosystem? These fundamental questions largely remain unanswered, establishing a crucial frontier for both academic inquiry and practical business strategy. Here, this paper delves into this complex landscape, aiming to develop a comprehensive understanding and a conceptual framework for pricing agentic AI systems.

The economic implications of AI have, for several years, drawn intense scholarly and industry interest {cite_009}{cite_014}. Early discussions centered on the impact of au
