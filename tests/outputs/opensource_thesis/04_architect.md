## Core Argument Flow

**Thesis Statement:** This paper argues that by developing and applying a novel multi-stakeholder sustainability framework, emerging non-software open initiatives (e.g., open hardware, open data) can foster greater resilience against geopolitical shifts and ensure more equitable value distribution, thereby extending the "saving the world" potential of open source beyond traditional software to address complex global challenges.

**Logical Progression:**
1.  Current global challenges require innovative, collaborative solutions, and open source principles offer a powerful paradigm (Introduction).
2.  While traditional Open Source Software (OSS) has demonstrated significant economic and social impact, existing research and sustainability models are primarily software-centric and fail to adequately address the long-term, multi-stakeholder sustainability, resilience, and equitable value distribution for *emerging, non-software open initiatives* in diverse geopolitical contexts (Literature Review & Gap).
3.  We propose a novel theoretical framework that integrates concepts of multi-stakeholder governance, resource commons, and socio-technical resilience to address these critical gaps for emerging open initiatives (Theoretical Framework).
4.  Through illustrative case studies of non-software open initiatives, we demonstrate how this framework can be applied to analyze and understand their sustainability challenges, resilience mechanisms, and approaches to equitable value distribution (Case Studies & Analysis).
5.  The application of this framework reveals critical insights into how these initiatives can achieve sustainable and equitable global impact, advancing both theory on open innovation and offering practical guidance for practitioners and policymakers (Discussion).
