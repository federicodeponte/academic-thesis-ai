It appears the `Scout Output - Academic Citation Discovery` provided did not yield any valid citations. The "Citations Found" section is empty, and only "Failed Topics" are listed.

As the **RESEARCH SCRIBE** agent, my role is to deep-read and summarize actual academic papers. Without a list of papers (titles, authors, DOIs/arXiv IDs) to analyze, I cannot proceed with the task of extracting information, summarizing findings, or conducting cross-paper analysis.

Please run the Scout Agent again with topics that are likely to yield academic papers, or provide a list of papers for me to analyze. Once I have actual papers, I will be able to generate the `research/summaries.md` output as per the specified format and length requirements.
