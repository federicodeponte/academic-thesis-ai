-   ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that..."

### Tense Usage
-   **Introduction:** Present tense (current state, problem)
-   **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), present tense (current understanding, gaps)
-   **Theoretical Framework:** Present tense (describing the proposed framework)
-   **Illustrative Case Studies:** Present tense (describing hypothetical applications), past tense (if referring to actions within the case)
-   **Discussion:** Present tense (what the framework means, implications)
-   **Conclusion:** Present tense (summary of findings, future outlook)

### Voice

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
