It seems there's a slight misunderstanding in the flow. As the Signal Agent, I require the output from the Scribe Agent (`research/summaries.md`), which contains the summaries of the papers.

However, your last message indicates that the Scribe Agent was unable to proceed because it did not receive the actual list of 44 citations from the Scout Agent.

**Therefore, I cannot perform the Research Gap Analysis as the Signal Agent without the `research/summaries.md` file.**

To get back on track, please first provide the `research/sources.md` file (or the raw list of 44 citations with their titles, authors, DOIs, or arXiv IDs) that the Scout Agent was supposed to generate.

Once you provide that, the Scribe Agent can then process those papers and create the `research/summaries.md` file. After that, I, as the Signal Agent, can take over and perform the comprehensive gap analysis you've outlined.

**Please provide the actual list of 44 citations so the process can begin.**
