## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support (e.g., Literature Review, Case Studies, Discussion)

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
