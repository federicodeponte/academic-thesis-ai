## Style Guide

### Academic Tone
- ✅ **Use:** "The results indicate...", "We observed...", "This suggests...", "The framework posits..."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that...", "I think..."

### Tense Usage
- **Introduction:** Present tense (current state of knowledge, problem)
- **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), Present tense (what existing models/theories are)
- **Framework (Methodology):** Present tense (describing the framework, its components)
- **Case Studies (Results):** Past tense (what was done in the analysis, what was found)
- **Discussion:** Present tense (what the findings mean, implications)
- **Conclusion:** Present tense (summary of contributions, future outlook)

### Voice
- **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active for clarity, passive for objectivity. In academic writing, a balance is often struck.
- ✅ "We analyzed the data" (active, clear)
- ✅ "The data were analyzed" (passive, objective, often used in methods)
- For theoretical arguments: "This framework proposes...", "The model integrates..."

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
