## Style Guide

### Academic Tone
-   ✅ **Use:** "The results indicate...", "We observed...", "This suggests...", "The framework posits..."
-   ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that...", "I think..."

### Tense Usage
-   **Introduction:** Present tense (current state of knowledge, the paper's aim).
-   **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), Present tense (what the literature currently shows).
-   **Theoretical Framework:** Present tense (the framework *is* proposed, *comprises* components).
-   **Case Studies / Analysis:** Past tense (what you *observed* in the case studies, what the data *showed*).
-   **Discussion:** Present tense (what the findings *mean*, what the implications *are*).
-   **Conclusion:** Present tense (summarizing the paper's contribution and findings).

### Voice
-   **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active voice for clarity and directness where appropriate (e.g., "We propose a framework"). Use passive voice for objectivity or to emphasize the action/object over the actor (e.g., "The data were analyzed," "The framework was developed").
-   ✅ "We analyzed the data to identify patterns." (active, clear)
-   ✅ "The data were analyzed for emergent patterns." (passive, objective)

## Next Steps

After formatting:
1.  Review this formatted outline meticulously against the specific guidelines of your *chosen* target journal/conference.
2.  Ensure all placeholders (e.g., `[TODO]`, `[Placeholder]`) are noted and understood for content generation.
3.  Proceed to the Compose phase with this clear, structured, and compliant outline.
4.  Save this output to `outline_formatted.md`.

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines (e.g., for the Literature Review, ensure you have actual papers that discuss those themes).
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics. The case studies should be real-world examples.
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with `[VERIFY]` or `[TODO]` for content that needs to be researched or confirmed.
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments, especially in the Theoretical Framework and Case Studies.
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support (e.g., every claim in the Literature Review, theoretical assertions in the Framework, interpretations in the Discussion).

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
