# Critical Review Report

**Reviewer Stance:** Constructively Critical
**Overall Assessment:** Accept with Major Revisions

---

## Summary

**Strengths:**
-   **Clear and logical flow:** The introduction effectively moves from the broad challenge of climate change to the specific role of CO2 certificate trading, identifying its theoretical benefits and practical challenges.
-   **Well-defined problem statement:** The research gap regarding the causal attribution of emission reductions to ETS, disentangling it from other factors, is clearly articulated and highly relevant.
-   **Precise research questions:** The four research questions directly address the identified problem statement and provide a clear roadmap for the study.
-   **Balanced perspective:** The introduction acknowledges both the potential and the criticisms/challenges of ETS, indicating a nuanced approach.

**Critical Issues:** 1 major, 2 moderate, 2 minor
**Recommendation:** Revisions needed before publication, primarily to address critical citation gaps.

## MAJOR ISSUES (Must Address)

### Issue 1: Missing Foundational Citations
**Location:** Throughout the first three paragraphs of the main introduction, and the third paragraph of the "Hintergrund und Motivation" section.
**Claim:** Core scientific consensus, climate change impacts, international agreements, and global adoption of ETS.
**Problem:** Several fundamental claims are marked with `cite_MISSING`, indicating a lack of specific, verifiable sources for critical information that forms the bedrock of the paper's context.
**Evidence:**
-   "{cite_MISSING: IPCC Assessment Reports}" for scientific consensus on anthropogenic emissions.
-   "{cite_MISSING: UNEP Emissions Gap Report}" for potential consequences of climate change.
-   "{cite_MISSING: Paris Agreement}" for the global commitment to climate targets.
-   "{cite_MISSING: World Bank Carbon Pricing Dashboard}" for the global prevalence of ETS.
**Fix:** Provide precise citations (including specific report names/years if applicable, e.g., "IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report") for all `cite_MISSING` tags. This is crucial for academic integrity and credibility.
**Severity:** 游댮 High - affects paper's foundational credibility and academic integrity.

## MODERATE ISSUES (Should Address)

### Issue 2: Precision in Research Gap Justification
**Location:** Problemstellung, paragraph 1
**Claim:** "Viele Studien konzentrieren sich auf 칬konomische Aspekte... vernachl칛ssigen jedoch oft eine aggregierte Analyse der direkten Umweltauswirkungen 칲ber l칛ngere Zeitr칛ume und unter Ber칲cksichtigung verschiedener Kontextfaktoren {cite_002}."
**Problem:** While {cite_002} (Pahle, Edenhofer et al., 2020 - a systematic review) is an excellent source for identifying research gaps, stating that "many studies neglect" this aspect based on a single review could be strengthened. A systematic review identifies gaps *within* the existing literature, so it serves as good evidence. However, for maximum impact, either:
    a) Rephrase to explicitly attribute the observation to the systematic review (e.g., "As highlighted by the systematic review by Pahle et al. (2020), many existing studies tend to focus on...").
    b) Briefly mention *why* this aggregated analysis is often neglected (e.g., due to methodological complexity, data availability challenges, or a focus on specific disciplinary aspects), which would further justify the research's importance.
**Fix:** Consider rephrasing or adding a brief explanation of *why* this gap exists, making the justification for the research even more robust.
**Severity:** 游리 Moderate - strengthens the argument for the identified research gap.

### Issue 3: Emphasizing the "Why" of ETS over other instruments
**Location:** Einleitung, paragraph 2
**Claim:** "Aus diesem Grund hat sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten ein wachsendes Interesse an marktbasierten Instrumenten entwickelt..."
**Problem:** While the text states "Traditionelle Regulierungen... sto른n jedoch oft an ihre Grenzen hinsichtlich Kosteneffizienz und Flexibilit칛t," and distinguishes ETS from CO2 tax, the specific comparative advantage or rationale for *focusing on ETS* (rather than other market-based instruments like a tax) could be slightly more emphasized. The introduction establishes ETS as a "vielversprechendes Instrument," but a brief, explicit statement on *why* ETS is the chosen focus for this study's in-depth analysis (e.g., its prevalence, complexity, or specific policy relevance) could enhance the justification.
**Fix:** Briefly elaborate on the specific reasons for focusing on ETS as the primary instrument of investigation, perhaps by highlighting its unique features or policy challenges compared to a carbon tax.
**Severity:** 游리 Moderate - improves the clarity of the study's scope and rationale.

## MINOR ISSUES

1.  **Outdated Self-Correction:** The "Hinweise zur 칖berarbeitung" section notes "Aktuell ist sie etwas k칲rzer" regarding the word count, but the "Wortzahl-Aufschl칲sselung" reports 1305 words, exceeding the 1200-word target. This discrepancy should be resolved.
2.  **Redundant Phrase:** In the "Problemstellung," the sentence "Die effektive Minderung von Treibhausgasemissionen ist f칲r die Begrenzung des Klimawandels von entscheidender Bedeutung" is a strong opening, but it slightly reiterates the very first sentence of the entire introduction. While not a major flaw, it could be made more concise or directly transition into the specific problem related to ETS effectiveness.

---

## Logical Gaps

No significant logical gaps were identified. The introduction flows logically from general context to specific problem and research questions.

---

## Methodological Concerns

No methodological concerns arise from the introduction section itself, as this section is primarily concerned with setting the stage for the research.

---

## Missing Discussions

No critical missing discussions were identified for an introduction section. The introduction successfully frames the problem and the scope of the paper.

---

## Tone & Presentation Issues

The tone is appropriately academic, objective, and balanced. The presentation is clear and well-structured.

---

## Questions a Reviewer Will Ask

1.  **"Where are the specific citations for these foundational claims (IPCC, UNEP, Paris Agreement, World Bank)?"** (This will be the very first question due to the `cite_MISSING` tags).
2.  "How do you justify focusing specifically on ETS rather than a broader comparison of carbon pricing instruments (e.g., including carbon taxes)?"
3.  "Can you provide more specific examples or a more detailed argument for why an 'aggregierte Analyse' is missing or particularly challenging, beyond referencing a systematic review?"
4.  "Which 'untersuchten Jurisdiktionen' will be included, and what is the rationale for their selection?" (This is more for the methods section, but the question implicitly arises from RQ1).

**Prepare answers or add to paper**

## Revision Priority

**Before resubmission:**
1.  游댮 **Fix Issue 1 (Missing Foundational Citations)** - This is absolutely critical for the paper's credibility and academic integrity.
2.  游리 Address Issue 2 (Precision in Research Gap Justification) - Strengthens the core argument for the research.
3.  游리 Address Issue 3 (Emphasizing the "Why" of ETS) - Clarifies the study's focus.

**Can defer:**
-   Minor wording issues and correcting the outdated word count note.
