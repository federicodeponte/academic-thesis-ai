## Notes for Revision

- [ ] **Critical:** Address all `cite_MISSING` placeholders. These are numerous and need specific sources to meet academic integrity requirements. The brief descriptions provided should guide the research process. Filling these will naturally expand the content.
- [ ] Expand on the specific mechanisms of how OSS drives innovation (e.g., modularity, forks, community governance models, API-first development).
- [ ] For economic benefits, consider adding a brief discussion on the "open core" business model or other ways companies monetize OSS to further elaborate on the economic ecosystem.
- [ ] Strengthen the connection between specific OSS characteristics (e.g., transparency, modifiability, community-driven maintenance) and environmental benefits, perhaps with more detailed examples of green computing initiatives using OSS.
- [ ] Ensure smooth transitions between paragraphs and sub-sections, especially when moving between different types of impact, potentially adding more explicit linking phrases.
- [ ] Review for any repetitive phrasing or ideas to ensure conciseness and varied expression.
- [ ] Check for consistency in terminology (e.g., ensure "OSS" and "Open Source Software" are used appropriately, typically defining the acronym on first use).
- [ ] The case studies are good, but could be slightly more integrated with the specific points of impact (e.g., explicitly stating "Linux demonstrates the economic benefits by..." or "Wikipedia exemplifies social inclusion through...") to reinforce the analytical points.
- [ ] **Word Count:** The section is currently at 2452 words, very close to the 2500-word target. Filling in the `cite_MISSING` placeholders with actual research and details will easily bring the section over the target, so further significant expansion is not strictly necessary beyond elaborating on cited points.
