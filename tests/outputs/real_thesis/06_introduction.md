## Content

The rapid proliferation of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) systems marks a transformative shift in how businesses operate, innovate, and interact with customers (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2017; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019). These autonomous entities, capable of perceiving their environment, making decisions, and executing actions to achieve specific goals (Russell & Norvig, 2021), are finding applications across diverse industries, from finance and healthcare to logistics and marketing (Agrawal et al., 2018; Davenport & Ronanki, 2018). This technological advancement, while offering unprecedented opportunities for efficiency gains and novel value creation, introduces significant challenges in establishing sustainable and equitable pricing models (Varian, 1996; Shapiro & Varian, 1998).

Current pricing strategies for agentic AI systems predominantly rely on input-based metrics, most notably "token" consumption (OpenAI, 2023). Tokens, representing the fundamental units of data processed by the AI model, serve as a convenient and seemingly transparent measure of resource utilization. However, this approach suffers from inherent limitations in accurately reflecting the true value delivered by the AI system (Greenstein & McDevitt, 2021). The number of tokens consumed provides little insight into the complexity of the task performed, the quality of the output generated, or the ultimate impact on the user's objectives (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2018). A simple query requiring a large number of tokens may generate minimal value, while a complex analysis using fewer tokens may unlock significant economic benefits. This disconnect between input cost and output value creates inefficiencies, hinders optimal resource allocation, and ultimately impedes the widespread adoption of agentic AI systems (Anderson, 2004; Brynjolfsson et al., 2006).

The inadequacy of token-based pricing is further exacerbated by the inherent opacity of complex AI algorithms. Users often lack a clear understanding of how their input translates into specific computational processes and, consequently, find it difficult to assess the fairness and justification of the charged price (Pasquale, 2015). This lack of transparency can erode trust, create perceptions of price gouging, and discourage experimentation with innovative AI applications (Edelman & Luca, 2014). Moreover, token-based pricing fails to account for the dynamic and context-dependent nature of value creation in agentic AI systems. The same AI system may generate vastly different levels of value for different users, depending on their specific needs, capabilities, and market conditions (Teece, 2010). A one-size-fits-all pricing model, based solely on token consumption, inevitably leads to suboptimal outcomes, with some users overpaying for limited value and others underpaying for substantial benefits (Armstrong, 2001).

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel value-based pricing framework for agentic AI systems, grounded in established principles of economic theory and tailored to the unique characteristics of this emerging technology. Drawing upon concepts from value pricing (Hinterhuber & Liozu, 2012), behavioral economics (Kahneman, 2011), and information economics (Stigler, 1961), we develop a comprehensive model that links the perceived value delivered by the AI system to the price charged to the user. This framework recognizes that value is subjective, context-dependent, and multifaceted, encompassing both tangible benefits (e.g., cost savings, revenue increases) and intangible advantages (e.g., improved decision-making, enhanced customer satisfaction) (Zeithaml, 1988). By aligning pricing with value, we aim to foster greater transparency, fairness, and efficiency in the market for agentic AI systems, thereby promoting innovation, adoption, and sustainable growth.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. First, we provide a critical review of existing pricing models for AI systems, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Second, we develop our value-based pricing framework, outlining the key components, relationships, and underlying assumptions. Third, we illustrate the applicability and advantages of our framework through case studies drawn from diverse industries, demonstrating how value-based pricing can be implemented in practice. Fourth, we discuss the implications of our framework for AI vendors, users, and policymakers, addressing potential challenges and opportunities. Finally, we conclude with a summary of our key findings and suggestions for future research, emphasizing the importance of adopting a value-centric perspective in the pricing of agentic AI systems.
