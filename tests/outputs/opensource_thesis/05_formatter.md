### ⚠️ CITATION REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL

**Specify citation style early and communicate to ALL Crafter agents:**

**Default Style:** APA 7th Edition (as specified by user)

**In-text citation format:**
```
✅ CORRECT: (Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author & Co-Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author et al., Year)
❌ WRONG: (Author [VERIFY]) - missing year
```

**Reference list requirements:**
- Use DOI when available: `https://doi.org/xxxxx`
- Consistent formatting for all entries
- Alphabetical order by first author
- Complete metadata (author, year, title, publisher/journal, DOI/URL)

**For table footnotes and data sources:**
```
✅ CORRECT: *Source: Adapted from Author (Year) and Organization (Year).*
❌ WRONG: *Source: Author (Year) [VERIFY].*
```

**[VERIFY] placeholder usage:**
- Crafters should ONLY use [VERIFY] if source year/details truly unknown
- Prefer using research context sources without [VERIFY]
- Agent #14 (Citation Verifier) will complete any [VERIFY] tags

**Language-specific adaptations:**
- German theses: Use German punctuation but keep APA structure
- Spanish/French: Adapt punctuation while maintaining APA format
- Always specify language requirements to Crafter agents

**Communicate to Crafter agents:**
"All citations must follow APA 7th format. Use (Author, Year) in-text. Only add [VERIFY] if you cannot determine the year from research context."

- **Introduction:** Present tense (current state, problem)
- **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), Present tense (current understanding)
- **Theoretical Framework:** Present tense (describing the framework)
- **Case Studies/Analysis:** Past tense (what was observed/found in the cases)
- **Discussion:** Present tense (what it means, implications)
- **Conclusion:** Present tense (summary of contributions, future outlook)

### Voice
- **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active for clarity, passive for objectivity. Strive for a balance.

## Next Steps

After formatting:
1. Review against target journal's specific author guidelines (if available, beyond general "Technology/Social Impact" scope)
2. Ensure all placeholders (`[VERIFY]`, `[Project Name]`, `[Global Challenge]`) are noted for the Crafter agents.
3. Proceed to Compose phase with this clear structure, ensuring Crafter agents are aware of all formatting and citation requirements.
4. Save to `outline_formatted.md`

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2. **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3. **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]
4. **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5. **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
