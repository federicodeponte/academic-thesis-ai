### ⚠️ CITATION REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL

**Specify citation style early and communicate to ALL Crafter agents:**

**Default Style:** APA 7th Edition (as specified by user)

**In-text citation format:**
```
✅ CORRECT: (Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author & Co-Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author et al., Year)
❌ WRONG: (Author [VERIFY]) - missing year
```

**Reference list requirements:**
- Use DOI when available: `https://doi.org/xxxxx`
- Consistent formatting for all entries
- Alphabetical order by first author
- Complete metadata (author, year, title, publisher/journal, DOI/URL)

**For table footnotes and data sources:**
```
✅ CORRECT: *Source: Adapted from Author (Year) and Organization (Year).*
❌ WRONG: *Source: Author (Year) [VERIFY].*
```

**[VERIFY] placeholder usage:**
- Crafters should ONLY use [VERIFY] if source year/details truly unknown or require specific confirmation.
- Prefer using research context sources without [VERIFY].
- Agent #14 (Citation Verifier) will complete any [VERIFY] tags.

**Language-specific adaptations:**
- For English language journals, maintain standard APA punctuation and formatting. If the paper were for a non-English venue, specific adaptations would be noted here.

**Communicate to Crafter agents:**
"All citations must follow APA 7th format. Use (Author, Year) in-text. Only add [VERIFY] if you cannot determine the year from research context."

## Style Guide

### Academic Tone
- ✅ **Use:** "The analysis indicates...", "This study observed...", "The framework suggests..."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that...", colloquialisms.

### Tense Usage
- **Abstract/Introduction:** Present tense (current state, purpose of paper).
- **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), present tense (current state of knowledge).
- **Theoretical Framework:** Present tense (describing the framework).
- **Case Studies:** Past tense (what was observed/applied in the cases).
- **Discussion:** Present tense (interpreting findings, implications).
- **Conclusion:** Present tense (summarizing contributions, future outlook).

### Voice
- **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active voice for clarity and directness where appropriate (e.g., "We propose a framework"). Use passive voice for objectivity when the actor is less important than the action (e.g., "The data were analyzed").
- ✅ "We analyzed the data" (active, clear)
- ✅ "The data were analyzed" (passive, objective)

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines (or ensure [VERIFY] is used appropriately).
2. **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics.
3. **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO] for subsequent agents.
4. **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments, especially for the theoretical framework and case studies.
5. **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support (e.g., literature review, theoretical grounding).

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
