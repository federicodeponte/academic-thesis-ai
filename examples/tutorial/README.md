## Step 1: Find Papers with Scout Agent (5-10 min)

### What You'll Do
Use the Scout Agent to find 10 relevant papers.

### Instructions

1. **Open the Scout Agent prompt:**
   ```bash
   # In your IDE
   open prompts/01_research/scout.md
   ```

2. **Read the prompt template** - It shows you exactly what to paste in your AI chat

3. **Customize the search request:**
   - Replace `[YOUR TOPIC]` with "artificial intelligence in education"
   - Replace `[NUMBER]` with "10"
   - Specify databases: "arXiv and Semantic Scholar"

4. **Paste into your AI chat** (Claude Code / Cursor)

5. **Expected Output:**
   ```
   1. Paper Title (Author, Year) - DOI: xxx
      Summary: [1-2 sentences]
      Relevance: 9/10

   2. [...]
   ```

6. **Save the output** to `examples/tutorial/01_scout_output.md`

### Tips
- If you get < 10 papers, broaden your search terms
- Look for papers with relevance scores 7+/10
- Note which papers seem most interesting

   - State the purpose of this paper
   - Use APA 7th edition citations
   ```

4. **Run the agent**

5. **Review the output:**
   - Is it the right length (~500 words)?

## Troubleshooting

**"Scout Agent didn't find papers"**
- Check your API key is configured
- Try broader search terms
- Make sure MCP servers are installed (`./mcp_servers/install_all.sh`)

**"Crafter Agent output is too generic"**
- Provide more detailed research notes
- Be specific about tone and style
- Include examples of what you want

**"PDF export failed"**
- Check Pandoc is installed: `which pandoc`
- Try different engine: `--engine libreoffice`
- Verify markdown file exists and is valid

**"Citations are wrong"**
- Use Verifier Agent: `prompts/04_validate/verifier.md`
- Double-check DOIs and author names
- Format manually in APA 7th edition if needed
