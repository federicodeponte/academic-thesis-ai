## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** While refining, preserve all citations and verification markers.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Never remove citations** during editing
2. **Preserve [VERIFY] markers** - don't hide uncertainty
3. **Don't add unsupported claims** even if they improve flow
4. **Maintain DOI/arXiv IDs** in all citations
5. **Flag if refinements created uncited claims**

**Polish the writing, not the evidence. Verification depends on accurate citations.**
