## Target Audience Considerations

**For this paper, assume readers:**
-   **Know:** Basic concepts of AI, machine learning, and LLMs; general understanding of academic research processes.

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines (e.g., the papers listed in the research gaps analysis are real and accurately reflect the described content).
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics. The "Illustrative Case Studies" are hypothetical but must be plausible and grounded in known academic challenges.
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO].
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments. The theoretical framework must build logically from existing concepts and address identified gaps.
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support:
    *   Literature Review (all subsections)
    *   Theoretical Framework (principles, architectural components, how it mitigates risks)
    *   Discussion (relation to literature, theoretical/practical implications)

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
