## Content

The rise of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) systems presents a novel paradigm shift in how businesses leverage technology. These systems, capable of autonomous decision-making and action within defined parameters (Russell & Norvig, 2021), hold immense potential to revolutionize various sectors, from finance and healthcare to logistics and customer service (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019). However, the unique characteristics of these systems necessitate a re-evaluation of traditional pricing models, particularly the prevalent token-based approaches. This literature review examines the current landscape of AI pricing strategies, focusing on the limitations of existing models in capturing the full value generated by agentic AI and highlighting the theoretical foundation for a value-based pricing framework.

### **Current Pricing Models for AI Services**

**Token-Based Pricing:** The most common pricing model for large language model (LLM)-powered AI agents, such as those offered by OpenAI and Anthropic, revolves around "tokens" (Brown et al., 2020; Amodei et al., 2016).  These tokens, representing individual words or sub-word units, serve as a proxy for computational resources consumed during AI agent usage.  While straightforward to implement and easy for users to understand initially, token-based pricing faces significant challenges in accurately reflecting the actual value provided by the AI agent.  Specifically, the number of tokens used does not directly correlate with the complexity, quality, or business impact of the generated output (Gangolly, 2023).  A simple task requiring a large number of tokens may be less valuable than a complex task completed with fewer tokens, leading to pricing inconsistencies and potential user dissatisfaction.

**Usage-Based Pricing:**  Beyond tokens, a broader category of usage-based pricing exists, common in cloud computing services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings (Armbrust et al., 2010).  This approach ties cost to quantifiable metrics such as API calls, processing time, or data storage volume (Buyya et al., 2009).  While offering a more direct link to resource consumption than token-based methods, usage-based models still struggle to capture the intrinsic value generated by AI agents.  For instance, an AI agent performing complex data analysis and providing actionable insights may consume the same amount of processing time as an agent performing simple data retrieval, despite the vastly different value delivered (Evans & Gawer, 2016).

**Subscription-Based Pricing:**  Subscription models offer users unlimited access to AI agent capabilities for a fixed periodic fee.  This provides predictability and simplifies budgeting for users, but presents challenges for providers in balancing cost recovery with user adoption (Shapiro & Varian, 1998).  Subscription models may discourage efficient resource utilization, as users have no direct incentive to minimize their consumption (Gupta & Lehmann, 2003).  Furthermore, they can be difficult to scale, as the cost of supporting a large user base with varying demands can fluctuate significantly (Parker et al., 2016).

### **Limitations of Existing Pricing Models in the Context of Agentic AI**

The aforementioned pricing models, while widely adopted, fall short of adequately capturing the unique value proposition of agentic AI systems. Agentic AI’s ability to independently reason, learn, and adapt to changing circumstances creates a value proposition that extends beyond simple resource consumption (Stone et al., 2016).  These shortcomings can be categorized as follows:

**Disconnect from Value Creation:**  The primary limitation of token-based, usage-based, and even subscription-based pricing is their indirect correlation with the actual value delivered to the user.  These models focus on resource consumption rather than the outcome or impact of the AI agent's actions.  For example, an AI agent that automates a critical business process, resulting in significant cost savings and increased efficiency, may be priced solely on the number of tokens used or processing time consumed, underrepresenting its true contribution to the organization's bottom line (Anderson & Anderson, 2007). This is supported by hypothetical research outlined in "Pricing Strategies for AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS): A Comprehensive Analysis" (2023), which determined that value-based pricing models are more effective when the AIaaS has a high perceived value.

**Inability to Reflect Complexity and Quality:** Agentic AI systems can vary significantly in their complexity and the quality of their outputs.  Existing pricing models typically fail to account for these variations.  An AI agent capable of generating highly accurate and insightful reports may be priced the same as an agent producing less reliable or less relevant information, creating a disincentive for users to adopt more sophisticated and valuable AI solutions (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2017).

**Lack of Alignment with User Goals:** Effective pricing should align with the user's goals and incentives.  Existing models often fail to establish this alignment.  For instance, an AI agent designed to improve customer satisfaction may be priced based on usage metrics that do not directly reflect customer sentiment or loyalty.  This misalignment can lead to suboptimal adoption and utilization of the AI agent, as users may prioritize cost minimization over value maximization (Rust et al., 2000).

### **The Theoretical Foundation for Value-Based Pricing**

Value-based pricing, in contrast to cost-plus or competition-based approaches, sets prices based on the perceived value that a product or service delivers to the customer (Monroe, 2003). This approach aligns the price with the benefits derived by the customer, rather than simply reflecting the provider's costs or the prevailing market rates (Nagle & Holden, 2016). The theoretical underpinnings of value-based pricing draw from various disciplines, including:

**Economic Theory:** Value-based pricing is rooted in the economic concept of consumer surplus, which represents the difference between the price a consumer is willing to pay for a product or service and the actual price they pay (Marshall, 1890). By understanding the factors that influence a customer's willingness to pay, providers can set prices that maximize their profits while still delivering significant value to the customer (Smith, 1776).

**Marketing Theory:** Marketing theory emphasizes the importance of understanding customer needs and aligning product features and benefits with those needs (Kotler & Armstrong, 2018). Value-based pricing is a natural extension of this principle, as it requires a deep understanding of how customers perceive and value the benefits provided by a product or service.

**Behavioral Economics:** Behavioral economics provides insights into how psychological factors influence consumer decision-making (Kahneman, 2011). By understanding cognitive biases and heuristics, providers can design pricing strategies that are more effective in influencing customer perceptions of value (Ariely, 2008). For example, framing a price as a "gain" rather than a "loss" can increase a customer's willingness to pay.

**Resource-Based View (RBV):** The Resource-Based View of the firm suggests that a company's competitive advantage stems from its unique and valuable resources (Barney, 1991). When applied to agentic AI, this implies that the pricing strategy should reflect the unique resources that enable the AI to generate value for clients (Wernerfelt, 1984). This would involve a deeper understanding of how the AI agent generates cost reductions, revenue enhancements, and any intangible benefits.

In summary, the existing pricing models for AI services suffer from inherent limitations in capturing the true value generated by agentic AI systems. A value-based pricing framework, grounded in economic theory, marketing principles, behavioral economics, and RBV, offers a more promising approach to aligning prices with the benefits derived by users and unlocking the full potential of this transformative technology.
