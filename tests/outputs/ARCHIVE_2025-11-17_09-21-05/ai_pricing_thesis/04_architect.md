## Core Argument Flow

**Thesis Statement:** Existing token-based pricing models are fundamentally misaligned with the autonomous, goal-oriented, and value-creating nature of agentic AI systems; a novel theoretical framework for value-based pricing is required to enable their sustainable development, fair monetization, and widespread adoption.

**Logical Progression:**
1.  Agentic AI systems represent a paradigm shift, but their unique characteristics pose significant challenges for traditional monetization (Introduction).
2.  Current token-based pricing models, inherited from LLMs, are inadequate for agentic AI, failing to capture their true value, complexity, and autonomy (Background/Literature Review).
3.  A significant gap exists in theoretical and practical understanding of how to price agentic AI systems based on the value they create, rather than mere computational inputs (Gap Identification).
4.  We propose a novel theoretical framework for value-based pricing of agentic AI, incorporating dimensions like outcome utility, risk, autonomy level, and long-term relationship value (Proposed Framework).
5.  Through illustrative case studies, we demonstrate how this value-based framework can be applied across diverse agentic AI scenarios, highlighting its practical implications and advantages over token-based models (Case Studies).
6.  This framework offers a more robust and equitable approach to agentic AI monetization, fostering innovation, aligning incentives, and addressing ethical concerns, thereby advancing the field (Discussion).

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines (e.g., all papers mentioned in "Papers to Cite" sections are placeholders and need real references).
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics. The case studies are illustrative, so they should be clearly framed as such, potentially drawing on publicly discussed scenarios.
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]. I have used [VERIFY] where specific citations are needed.
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments. The theoretical framework must be logically sound and built upon existing, cited theories.
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support. These are primarily the "Background & Literature Review" and the theoretical underpinnings of the "Proposed Theoretical Framework."

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
