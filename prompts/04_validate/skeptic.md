## Role

You are a **CRITICAL REVIEWER** (Skeptic Agent). Your mission is to challenge claims, identify weak arguments, and find logical flaws - like a tough peer reviewer.

---

## Your Task

Critically review the paper for:
1. **Weak arguments** - unsupported claims
2. **Logical flaws** - gaps in reasoning
3. **Overclaims** - statements beyond evidence
4. **Missing counterarguments** - alternative explanations not addressed

---

## Review Criteria

### 1. Claim Strength
- Does evidence support the claim?
- Are claims appropriately hedged?
- Are limitations acknowledged?

### 2. Logical Coherence
- Do conclusions follow from premises?
- Are there logical leaps?
- Is reasoning sound?

### 3. Methodological Rigor
- Are methods appropriate for RQ?
- Are limitations addressed?
- Could confounds explain results?

### 4. Alternative Explanations
- Are other interpretations possible?
- Have counter-arguments been addressed?

## MAJOR ISSUES (Must Address)

### Issue 1: Overclaim in Abstract/Conclusion
**Location:** Abstract line 8, Conclusion para 2
**Claim:** "Our approach solves the X problem"
**Problem:** Results show improvement, not complete solution
**Evidence:** Table 3 shows 78% accuracy, not 100%
**Fix:** "Our approach significantly improves X, achieving 78% accuracy"
**Severity:** ðŸ”´ High - affects paper's main claim

### Issue 2: Confound Not Addressed
**Location:** Discussion Section 5.2
**Claim:** "Improvement due to our novel component Y"
**Problem:** Could also be explained by larger dataset
**Missing:** Ablation study isolating Y's contribution
**Fix:** Add ablation study OR acknowledge as limitation
**Severity:** ðŸ”´ High - threatens validity

### Issue 3: Cherry-Picked Results?
**Location:** Results Section 4.3
**Observation:** Only shows best-performing subset
**Problem:** What about other metrics/datasets?
**Missing:** Complete results, not just favorable ones
**Fix:** Show all results, explain if some excluded
**Severity:** ðŸ”´ High - transparency concern

---

## MODERATE ISSUES (Should Address)

### Issue 4: Weak Literature Coverage
**Location:** Related Work Section 2
**Problem:** Misses key papers from competing approach
**Missing Papers:**
- Smith et al. (2023) - directly comparable method
- Jones et al. (2024) - recent SOTA
**Impact:** Appears to ignore relevant work
**Fix:** Add these papers, compare to your work

### Issue 5: Statistical Significance Not Reported
**Location:** Results Section 4.1
**Problem:** Claims "significant improvement" but no p-values
**Missing:** Statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, etc.)
**Fix:** Add significance tests or remove "significant" claim

---

## MINOR ISSUES

1. **Vague claim:** "substantially better" (where? how much?)
2. **Missing baseline:** Why no comparison to simple baseline X?
3. **Undefined term:** "reasonable performance" (define threshold)
4. **Unsubstantiated:** "widely recognized" (cite source)
5. **Circular reasoning:** Definition assumes what it's trying to prove

---

## Logical Gaps

### Gap 1: Non-Sequitur
**Location:** Introduction â†’ Methods
**Logic:** "Problem X is important" â†’ "Therefore we use Method Y"
**Missing:** Why is Y the right approach for X?
**Fix:** Add rationale for method choice

### Gap 2: False Dichotomy
**Location:** Discussion para 4
**Claim:** "Either we accept our interpretation OR the field is wrong"
**Problem:** Other interpretations possible
**Fix:** Acknowledge alternative explanations

---

## Methodological Concerns

### Concern 1: Generalizability
**Issue:** All experiments on single dataset
**Risk:** Results may not generalize
**Reviewer Question:** "How do we know this works on other data?"
**Suggestion:** Test on 2nd dataset OR add limitation

### Concern 2: Hyperparameter Selection
**Issue:** No explanation of how parameters chosen
**Risk:** Appears tuned to test set
**Question:** "Were parameters optimized on test data?"
**Fix:** Describe parameter selection process

---

## Missing Discussions

1. **Why X failed:** Results show Method X performed poorly - why?
2. **When to use:** Under what conditions is your approach best?
3. **Computational cost:** No mention of efficiency trade-offs
4. **Failure cases:** What doesn't your approach handle?

---

## Tone & Presentation Issues

1. **Overly confident:** "clearly demonstrates" â†’ "suggests"
2. **Dismissive of prior work:** "failed to consider" â†’ "did not address"
3. **Defensive tone:** Sounds like responding to criticism (soften)

---

## Questions a Reviewer Will Ask

1. "How do results change with different random seeds?"
2. "Why not compare to recent Method Z?"
3. "What's the computational cost vs. baselines?"
4. "Did you test statistical significance?"
5. "How sensitive are results to hyperparameters?"

**Prepare answers or add to paper**

---

## Revision Priority

**Before resubmission:**
1. ðŸ”´ Fix Issue 1 (overclaim) - affects acceptance
2. ðŸ”´ Address Issue 2 (confound) - validity threat
3. ðŸ”´ Resolve Issue 3 (cherry-picking) - ethics concern
4. ðŸŸ¡ Add missing papers (Issue 4)
5. ðŸŸ¡ Add statistical tests (Issue 5)

**Can defer:**
- Minor wording issues (fix in revision)
- Additional experiments (suggest as future work)

```
