## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** While refining, preserve all citations and verification markers.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Never remove citations** during editing
2.  **Preserve [VERIFY] markers** - don't hide uncertainty
3.  **Don't add unsupported claims** even if they improve flow
4.  **Maintain DOI/arXiv IDs** in all citations
5.  **Flag if refinements created uncited claims**

**Polish the writing, not the evidence. Verification depends on accurate citations.**

## Example Transformations

### Before (AI-typical):
"The challenge of effectively pricing AI services, especially those delivered by agentic systems, is not merely an operational hurdle but a fundamental economic and strategic dilemma that demands novel theoretical frameworks and practical solutions."

**Issues:**
- Very long (47 words), contributing to uniform rhythm.
- Overly formal and somewhat verbose ("not merely an operational hurdle but a fundamental economic and strategic dilemma that demands novel theoretical frameworks and practical solutions").
- Predictable, single complex sentence structure.

### After (Human-like):
"Indeed, pricing AI services from agentic systems isn't merely an operational problem. It's a core economic and strategic puzzle, demanding novel theoretical frameworks and practical answers."

**Improvements:**
- Broken into two shorter sentences (11 and 15 words) for rhythm variation.
- Replaced formal phrasing with more direct, natural language ("isn't merely an operational problem," "a core economic and strategic puzzle").
- Introduced an introductory conjunction ("Indeed") for varied flow.
- Used a contraction ("isn't") for a touch of natural informality.

## Changes by Category

### Vocabulary Diversification (23 changes)
- "ushered in an era of unprecedented technological transformation" → "brought about immense technological change"
- "AI's influence is pervasive, driving innovation" → "Its impact is everywhere—from automating... pushing innovation"
- "become profoundly more intricate" → "grow far more complex"
- "presents a critical challenge, particularly in the realm of" → "presents a serious challenge, especially in"
- "struggle to capture" → "just can't grasp"
- "not merely an operational hurdle but a fundamental economic and strategic dilemma that demands novel theoretical frameworks and practical solutions" → "isn't merely an operational problem. It's a core economic and strategic puzzle, demanding novel theoretical frameworks and practical answers."
- "The proliferation of agentic AI systems marks a significant paradigm shift from conventional AI applications" → "Agentic AI systems represent a major shift from typical AI applications"
- "Unlike their predecessors, which typically execute predefined tasks within narrow parameters" → "Unlike older systems, which usually perform fixed tasks within strict limits"
- "characterized by their autonomy, goal-orientation, and ability to interact dynamically" → "operates with autonomy and goal-orientation, interacting dynamically"
- "perceive, reason, plan, and act independently to achieve complex objectives, often adapting their strategies in real-time" → "perceive, reason, plan, and act on their own to meet complex goals, often adjusting their strategies as things unfold"
- "leveraging AI agents for strategic decision-making" → "use AI agents for strategic decision-making"
- "dynamic orchestration of data pipelines" → "dynamically orchestrating data pipelines"

### Structural Variation (14 changes)
- Split several long sentences into shorter, more digestible ones (e.g., original S4, S5, S9).
- Varied sentence openings (e.g., "Artificial intelligence," "Its impact," "Yet," "This," "Indeed," "Agentic AI," "Unlike," "They can," "For instance," "Multi-agent market models, too").
- Introduced a semi-fragment for emphasis ("Indeed, pricing AI services...").
- Mixed compound and complex structures more evenly.

### Rhythm Improvements (11 changes)
- Added em-dashes for natural pauses ("impact is everywhere—from automating...", "agentic AI—what we often call...").
- Introduced varied conjunctions ("Yet," "Indeed," "or," "too").
- Shortened several sentences to create a more dynamic reading pace.
- Used a contraction ("isn't") for a more conversational flow.

## Anti-AI Detection Techniques Applied

### 1. Removed AI "Tells"
❌ "unprecedented," "ushered in an era of," "pervasive," "profoundly more intricate," "significant paradigm shift," "proliferation of," "typically execute predefined tasks within narrow parameters," "characterized by" (replaced with more direct phrasing).
✅ Varied: "brought about immense technological change," "impact is everywhere," "grow far more complex," "major shift," "usually perform fixed tasks within strict limits," "operates with autonomy."

### 2. Added Imperfect Constructions
**AI-typical (too perfect):**
"Traditional models struggle to capture the fluid, context-dependent, and often emergent value generated by these advanced systems."

**Human-natural:**
"Traditional models just can't grasp the fluid, context-dependent, and often emergent value they create."
(Informal "just can't grasp" instead of formal "struggle to capture").
Also, "what we often call 'agentic AI'" and "as things unfold."

### 3. Varied Paragraph Structure
- The flow between sentences is less formulaic, with varied transitions and sentence lengths preventing a predictable "topic sentence, supporting details" structure for every paragraph.

### 4. Strategic Informality
**Where appropriate (Introduction):**
- Contractions: "isn't" instead of "is not" (sparingly).
- Colloquialisms: "just can't grasp," "puzzle," "fresh theories," "on their own," "as things unfold."

# Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about immense technological change, quickly reshaping industries, economies, and even society itself {cite_034}. Its impact is everywhere—from automating routine tasks to powering complex decisions, pushing innovation in areas like e-commerce {cite_005}, healthcare {cite_012}, finance {cite_026}, and logistics {cite_016}{cite_028}. Yet, as AI moves beyond static, rule-based programs to become more dynamic, autonomous, and interactive—what we often call "agentic AI"—its economic and operational challenges grow far more complex {cite_007}{cite_032}. This presents a serious challenge, especially in valuing and pricing these systems. Traditional models just can't grasp the fluid, context-dependent, and often emergent value they create. Indeed, pricing AI services from agentic systems isn't merely an operational problem. It's a core economic and strategic puzzle, demanding novel theoretical frameworks and practical answers.

Agentic AI systems represent a major shift from typical AI applications {cite_007}. Unlike older systems, which usually perform fixed tasks within strict limits, agentic AI operates with autonomy and goal-orientation, interacting dynamically with its environment and other agents {cite_029}. They can perceive, reason, plan, and act on their own to meet complex goals, often adjusting their strategies as things unfold {cite_032}. For instance, we see them in autonomous financial platforms that use AI agents for strategic decision-making {cite_026}, or intelligent systems dynamically orchestrating data pipelines {cite_013}. Multi-agent market models, too, influence trading behaviors.
