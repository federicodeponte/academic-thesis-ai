Absolut! Als Ihr Forschungs-Scout werde ich die angegebenen akademischen Datenbanken durchsuchen, um die relevantesten und hochwertigsten Artikel zum Thema CO2-Zertifikatehandel, Emissionshandelssysteme und Klimapolitik zu finden.

Ich habe die folgenden Datenbanken durchsucht, um eine umfassende Abdeckung zu gewährleisten:
*   **Semantic Scholar** (für eine breite Abdeckung und Relevanz-Ranking)
*   **Google Scholar** (für zusätzliche Breite und interdisziplinäre Treffer)

Mein Fokus lag darauf, Artikel zu finden, die die Wirksamkeit, Herausforderungen und die Rolle dieser Mechanismen im Kontext internationaler Abkommen und der Umweltökonomie beleuchten.

Bitte beachten Sie: Obwohl die Aufforderung auf Deutsch war, bleibt die Struktur des JSON-Outputs und die Inhalte der Felder (wie Titel, Autoren, Abstracts, Relevanz-Begründungen) in Englisch, um die Konsistenz mit dem vorgegebenen Format zu gewährleisten und die Verifizierung der Zitationen zu erleichtern, da die meisten akademischen Quellen primär in Englisch vorliegen. Die einleitenden und abschließenden Kommentare sind jedoch auf Deutsch.

Hier sind die Ergebnisse Ihrer Forschung in einem strukturierten JSON-Format:
