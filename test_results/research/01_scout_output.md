## Research Gaps Noticed

1. **Limited Evaluation on Non-English Literature** - Most papers focus on English papers only
2. **Lack of Real-World Deployment Studies** - Few papers report on actual usage by researchers
3. **Hallucination Mitigation** - Citation hallucination remains a significant challenge
4. **Domain-Specific Challenges** - Most work is on CS/ML papers, limited medical/social sciences coverage
5. **Human-AI Collaboration** - Limited work on optimal division of labor between humans and LLMs
6. **Long-term Studies** - No longitudinal studies of LLM-assisted literature review over months/years
7. **Cross-Domain Transfer** - How well do methods trained on CS papers work in biology, social sciences?

---

## Suggested Search Refinements

1. Add "retrieval-augmented generation" to capture RAG-based approaches
2. Search for "systematic review automation" specifically in medical domain
3. Look for "citation hallucination" mitigation techniques
4. Search recent 2024 papers on arXiv (last 3 months)
5. Include "knowledge graph" + "scientific literature" for graph-based approaches
