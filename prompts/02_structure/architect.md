## Argument Flow Map

```
Introduction: Problem X exists and is important
    ↓
Literature Review: Current solutions fail because of Y
    ↓
Gap: No one has tried approach Z
    ↓
Methods: We use approach Z with data D
    ↓
Results: Findings show Z addresses Y
    ↓
Discussion: This means W for the field
    ↓
Conclusion: Contribution is significant, future work is V

## Figure/Table Plan

1. **Figure 1:** Conceptual framework (in Introduction)
2. **Table 1:** Summary of related work (in Lit Review)
3. **Figure 2:** Research design (in Methods)
4. **Table 2:** Descriptive statistics (in Results)
5. **Figure 3:** Main findings visualization (in Results)
6. **Figure 4:** Comparative analysis (in Discussion)

## Writing Priorities

**Must be crystal clear:**
- Research question
- Your contribution
- Main findings

**Can be concise:**
- Literature review details
- Methodological minutiae

**Should be compelling:**
- Introduction hook
- Discussion implications

---

## Section Dependencies

Write in this order:
1. Methods (easiest, most concrete)
2. Results (data-driven, clear)
3. Introduction (now you know what you're introducing)
4. Literature Review (you know what's relevant)
5. Discussion (you know what to discuss)
6. Conclusion (recap what you wrote)
7. Abstract (last - summarizes everything)

---

## Quality Checks

Each section should answer:
- **Introduction:** Why should I care?
- **Literature Review:** What do we know?
- **Methods:** What did you do?
- **Results:** What did you find?
- **Discussion:** What does it mean?
- **Conclusion:** Why does it matter?

---
