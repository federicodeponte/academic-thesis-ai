## Title
"Hybrid Physical-AI Models for Long-Term Climate Prediction: A Deep Learning Approach"

---

## Abstract (250 words)

Climate prediction remains challenging due to complex atmospheric dynamics and computational constraints. Existing approaches rely either on physics-based models with high computational costs or data-driven methods lacking interpretability. We present HybridClimate, a novel framework combining physical climate models with deep learning to improve prediction accuracy while maintaining interpretability.

Our approach integrates numerical weather prediction models with transformer-based neural networks, leveraging strengths of both paradigms. We train on 40 years of global climate data and validate on held-out recent observations.

Results show HybridClimate achieves 23% improvement in temperature prediction accuracy (RMSE 0.45°C vs 0.58°C) and 31% improvement in precipitation forecasting compared to state-of-the-art physics-only models. The hybrid approach maintains interpretability through attention mechanisms revealing which physical processes drive predictions.

This work demonstrates feasibility of combining domain knowledge with machine learning for complex scientific problems, with implications for climate policy and disaster preparedness.
