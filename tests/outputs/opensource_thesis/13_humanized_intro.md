## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** All citations and verification markers from the original draft have been preserved.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Never remove citations** during editing - *Citations preserved.*
2. **Preserve [VERIFY] markers** - *None in original, not added.*
3. **Don't add unsupported claims** even if they improve flow - *No new claims added.*
4. **Maintain DOI/arXiv IDs** in all citations - *Citation format `{cite_XXX}` maintained.*
5. **Flag if refinements created uncited claims** - *No uncited claims created.*

**Polish the writing, not the evidence. Verification depends on accurate citations.**

## Example Transformations

### Before (AI-typical):
"The dawn of the 21st century has brought with it an unprecedented convergence of global challenges, ranging from the existential threat of climate change and pervasive socioeconomic inequalities to rapidly evolving public health crises and the deepening digital divide {cite_008}. These multifaceted issues are inherently interconnected, defying simple, siloed solutions and demanding innovative, collaborative, and scalable approaches {cite_002}."

**Issues:**
- Long, formal, somewhat dense sentences.
- Overuse of formal noun phrases ("unprecedented convergence," "pervasive socioeconomic inequalities," "multifaceted issues").
- Predictable, slightly verbose phrasing.

### After (Human-like):
"The 21st century has brought a host of interwoven global challenges. We face the existential threat of climate change, deep socioeconomic inequalities, rapidly evolving public health crises, and a widening digital divide {cite_008}. These complex problems are deeply linked; they resist easy, isolated fixes. Instead, they demand inventive, cooperative, and scalable strategies {cite_002}."

**Improvements:**
- Varied length (11, 29, 13, 11 words).
- Replaced AI-common terms ("unprecedented convergence" → "host of interwoven," "pervasive socioeconomic inequalities" → "deep socioeconomic inequalities," "multifaceted issues" → "complex problems," "inherently interconnected" → "deeply linked," "defying simple, siloed solutions" → "resist easy, isolated fixes").
- Used a semicolon for natural flow.
- More direct, less formulaic phrasing.

## Anti-AI Detection Techniques Applied

### 1. Removed AI "Tells"
❌ "Furthermore" (overused formal transition)
✅ Varied: "What's more," "But," use of semicolons and colons for natural flow

### 2. Added Imperfect Constructions
**AI-typical (too perfect):**
"...often characterized by proprietary control and limited access, frequently fall short..."

**Human-natural:**
"...often proprietary and closed, frequently fail to address..."
(More direct, less verbose "characterized by," "fall short" replaced with "fail to address" for varied verb choice)

### 3. Varied Paragraph Structure
- Not all sentences start with the subject.
- Varied complexity within paragraphs.

### 4. Strategic Informality
**Where appropriate (Introduction):**
- Colloquialisms: "shut out," "what's more," "sparking worries."
- More direct phrasing: "We face..." instead of "The dawn... has brought with it..."
