## Style Guide

### Academic Tone
-   ✅ **Use:** "The results indicate...", "We observed...", "This suggests...", "The framework posits..."
-   ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that...", "I think..."

### Tense Usage
-   **Introduction:** Present tense (current state of knowledge, the paper's purpose)
-   **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), Present tense (current state of the field, gaps)
-   **Theoretical Framework:** Present tense (the framework "proposes," "defines," "explains")
-   **Illustrative Case Studies:** Past tense (what was done in selecting/describing cases)
-   **Case Study Findings:** Past tense (what was observed in the cases)
-   **Discussion:** Present tense (what the findings mean, implications), Past tense (referring to the study's findings)
-   **Conclusion:** Present tense (summary of the paper's contribution and implications)

### Voice
-   **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active for clarity, passive for objectivity. Strive for a balance.
-   ✅ "We analyzed the case studies" (active, clear)
-   ✅ "The data were analyzed" (passive, objective)
-   ✅ "The framework proposes..." (active, clear)

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines (especially for the Literature Review and Case Study sections).
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics.
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO] for any details not fully confirmed.
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments, even with illustrative case studies.
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support (e.g., claims in the Literature Review, background for case studies).

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
