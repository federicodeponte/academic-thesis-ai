## 🔒 Ethics & Responsible Use

### Important Principles

1. **You are the author** - AI assists, doesn't replace
2. **Verify everything** - Check all claims and citations
3. **Disclose AI use** - Follow your institution's policies
4. **Maintain integrity** - No plagiarism, no fabrication

See `ETHICS.md` for comprehensive guidelines.

### AI Detection

The Entropy Agent helps make your writing more natural, NOT disguise authorship:

```bash
# Check AI detection score
python utils/ai_detection.py paper.md
# Target: < 20% for natural-sounding writing
```

Use this to improve YOUR OWN writing, not hide AI assistance.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### MCP Servers Not Working

```bash
# Restart IDE after installation
# Check config file exists
ls ~/.config/Claude\ Code/mcp_config.json  # or ~/.cursor/mcp_config.json

# Test individual servers
arxiv-mcp-server --help
```

### Agent Responses Too Generic

- Attach more context files (research notes, outline)
- Be specific in your instructions
- Iterate with follow-up prompts

### Installation Issues

```bash
# Python dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Permission issues
chmod +x mcp_servers/install_all.sh
chmod +x utils/*.py
```

### Rate Limiting

- **Semantic Scholar:** Get free API key for higher limits
- **Google Scholar:** Use sparingly (scraping-based)
- **LLM APIs:** Monitor your usage/billing
