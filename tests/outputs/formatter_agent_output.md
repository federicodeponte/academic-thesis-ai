- ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that..."

### Tense Usage
- **Introduction:** Present tense (current state)
- **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found)
- **Methods:** Past tense (what you did)
- **Results:** Past tense (what you found)
- **Discussion:** Present tense (what it means)

### Voice
- **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active for clarity, passive for objectivity
- ✅ "We analyzed the data" (active, clear)
- ✅ "The data were analyzed" (passive, objective)
