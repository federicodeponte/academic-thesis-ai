**In-text citation format:**
```
✅ CORRECT: (Author, Year)
✅ CORRECT: (Author & Co-Author, Year)

### Introduction
**Heading:** (No heading for Introduction in APA 7th, text starts directly after Abstract and Keywords)
**Length:** 1000-1500 words
**Content:**
- Introduce OSS as a powerful paradigm for solving global problems.
- Highlight its potential for positive change and "saving the world."

- Briefly state the paper's purpose: to propose a holistic sustainability framework.
- Thesis Statement: While Open Source Software holds immense potential to drive global positive change and "save the world" through collaboration and innovation, its full impact is contingent upon the long-term sustainability of its projects, which current frameworks inadequately address, particularly in developing contexts and for emerging technologies; therefore, a novel, holistic sustainability framework is necessary to guide sustainable OSS development and maximize its global impact.
