## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** While refining, preserve all citations and verification markers.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Never remove citations** during editing (All `cite_MISSING` and `cite_001` preserved)
2.  **Preserve [VERIFY] markers** - don't hide uncertainty (No `[VERIFY]` markers in original, but `cite_MISSING` are preserved)
3.  **Don't add unsupported claims** even if they improve flow (No new claims added)
4.  **Maintain DOI/arXiv IDs** in all citations (N/A for this draft's citation style)
5.  **Flag if refinements created uncited claims** (No uncited claims created)

**Polish the writing, not the evidence. Verification depends on accurate citations.**

## Example Transformations

### Before (AI-typical):
"The 21st century is defined by an array of intricate, interconnected global challenges, ranging from climate change and widespread poverty to persistent inequalities and the accelerating digital divide {cite_MISSING: Source on global challenges}. Addressing these multifaceted issues necessitates innovative, collaborative, and adaptable solutions that transcend traditional boundaries."

**Issues:**
- Long, formal sentences (30 words, 17 words)
- Overuse of formal verbs ("is defined by," "necessitates")
- Predictable, slightly detached tone

### After (Human-like):
"The 21st century grapples with a complex web of global challenges {cite_MISSING: Source on global challenges}. These include climate change, widespread poverty, persistent inequalities, and a rapidly expanding digital divide. Tackling such multifaceted issues demands solutions that are not only innovative and collaborative but also adaptable—solutions that move beyond old ways of thinking."

**Improvements:**
- Varied length (11, 16, 21 words)
- Replaced "is defined by" with active "grapples with"
- Broke a long sentence into two for better rhythm
- Used em-dash for natural pause
- More direct and engaging language ("move beyond old ways of thinking")

---

### Before (AI-typical):
"While technological advancements offer unprecedented opportunities for progress, their potential is often constrained by proprietary models that limit access, impose high costs, and hinder local adaptation and collaborative development. This paper argues that Open Source Software (OSS) presents a powerful, often underutilized, paradigm for fostering sustainable development and addressing critical global challenges."

**Issues:**
- Very long sentence (33 words) followed by another long one (23 words)
- Formal phrasing ("unprecedented opportunities," "constrained by," "presents a paradigm")
- Slightly clunky transitions

### After (Human-like):
"However, the full promise of tech often gets held back by proprietary models. These models restrict access, drive up costs, and make it tough to adapt tools locally or develop them collaboratively. This paper, therefore, argues that Open Source Software (OSS) offers a potent, often overlooked, approach for fostering sustainable development and tackling these crucial global challenges head-on."

**Improvements:**
- Broke a long sentence into two shorter, clearer ones (12, 18 words)
- Introduced a natural transition ("However")
- Replaced formal terms with simpler, more direct language ("full promise of tech" for "unprecedented opportunities," "gets held back by" for "constrained by," "make it tough to adapt" for "hinder local adaptation," "approach" for "paradigm")
- Added a touch of emphasis ("head-on")

## Changes by Category

### Vocabulary Diversification (15+ changes)
- "is defined by" → grapples with
- "array of intricate, interconnected" → complex web of
- "necessitates" → demands
- "pivotal force" → dual role
- "exacerbating and mitigating" → worsen these problems, yet it also offers powerful tools to mitigate them
- "unprecedented opportunities" → full promise of tech
- "constrained by" → gets held back by
- "hinder local adaptation" → make it tough to adapt tools locally
- "presents a paradigm" → offers an approach
- "underutilized" → overlooked
- "pervasive force across nearly all sectors" → pervasive force touching almost every sector
- "emphasizes the freedom" → began to champion the freedom
- "ethos fosters" → core philosophy cultivates
- "inherent advantages" → clear benefits
- "ability to customize" → capacity to tailor

### Structural Variation (8+ changes)
- Broke long sentences into shorter, more digestible units (e.g., S1, S4, S8)
- Varied sentence openings (e.g., "Born from principles...", "Its origins trace...")
- Introduced colons for explanation and clarity (e.g., "dual role here:")
- Used em-dashes for natural asides and emphasis (e.g., "adaptable—solutions that move...", "communities—developers, users, organizations alike—")
- Mixed active ("grapples with," "demands," "champions") and natural passive voice ("gets held back by").

### Rhythm Improvements (10+ changes)
- Introduced more short sentences to break up longer ones.
- Rephrased complex clauses into more direct, flowing phrases.
- Added natural pauses using punctuation like em-dashes and colons.
- Used varied conjunctions and transitional phrases ("However," "This paper, therefore, argues...").

## Anti-AI Detection Techniques Applied

### 1. Removed AI "Tells"
❌ "Additionally, furthermore, moreover, consequently" (not present in original, but avoided similar overly formal transitions)
✅ Varied: "However," "This paper, therefore, argues," "Instead," "Its origins trace back," creating a more natural, less formulaic flow.

### 2. Added Imperfect Constructions
**AI-typical (too perfect):**
"The potential is constrained by proprietary models."

**Human-natural:**
"The full promise of tech often gets held back by proprietary models."
(Used "gets held back by" instead of "is constrained by"; "tech" instead of "technology" for slight informality where appropriate).

### 3. Varied Paragraph Structure
- The second paragraph now starts with a participial phrase ("Born from principles...") rather than a standard subject-verb opening, adding structural variety.
- Sentences within paragraphs vary in their internal structure, not always adhering to a strict subject-verb-object.

### 4. Strategic Informality
**Where appropriate (Introduction, setting the stage):**
- Contractions: "It's" instead of "It is" (sparingly).
- Colloquialisms: "grapples with," "complex web," "old ways of thinking," "gets held back," "tough to adapt," "head-on."
- Directness: "These include..." instead of a single, long enumeration.

## Humanized Introduction

The 21st century grapples with a complex web of global challenges {cite_MISSING: Source on global challenges}. These include climate change, widespread poverty, persistent inequalities, and a rapidly expanding digital divide. Tackling such multifaceted issues demands solutions that are not only innovative and collaborative but also adaptable—solutions that move beyond old ways of thinking. Technology, especially information and communication technologies (ICTs), plays a dual role here: it can worsen these problems, yet it also offers powerful tools to mitigate them {cite_MISSING: Source on technology's dual role}. However, the full promise of tech often gets held back by proprietary models. These models restrict access, drive up costs, and make it tough to adapt tools locally or develop them collaboratively. This paper, therefore, argues that Open Source Software (OSS) offers a potent, often overlooked, approach for fostering sustainable development and tackling these crucial global challenges head-on.

Born from principles of transparency, collaboration, and free access, the Open Source Software (OSS) movement has grown significantly. It's no longer just a niche technical phenomenon; instead, it's a pervasive force touching almost every sector of the global economy and society. Its origins trace back to the free software movement of the 1980s, a time when OSS began to champion the freedom to run, study, modify, and distribute software {cite_MISSING: Definition of free software principles}. This core philosophy cultivates a distinctive development model: source code remains openly accessible. This openness empowers communities—developers, users, organizations alike—to collectively inspect, adapt, and improve software solutions. OSS has seen widespread adoption, driven by clear benefits such as lower costs, improved security via peer review, greater flexibility, and the capacity to tailor software to precise requirements {cite_001}. Beyond these practical
