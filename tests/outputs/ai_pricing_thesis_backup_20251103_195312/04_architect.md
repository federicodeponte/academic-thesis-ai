**Sections:**

#### 3.1 Hook & Context (200 words)
-   **Opening:** The rise of autonomous AI agents promises a paradigm shift in how we interact with technology, moving from tools to collaborators.
-   **Why this matters:** The economic models underpinning these agents will dictate their development, adoption, and societal impact, yet current approaches are fundamentally misaligned.
-   **Current state:** AI pricing is largely dominated by token-based models, inherited from foundational LLMs, which track computational inputs/outputs rather than outcomes.

#### 3.2 Problem Statement (200 words)
-   **The gap:** Token-based pricing, while simple, fails to account for emergent behavior, complex decision-making, and the often disproportionate value generated by agentic AI. It doesn't capture user-perceived value, the cost of agent "thinking," or value distribution in multi-agent systems.
-   **Why it's important:** This misalignment stifles innovation, creates economic inefficiencies, and hinders the development of truly sophisticated and trustworthy AI agents.
-   **Challenges:** Attributing value in non-deterministic, autonomous systems is inherently complex, involving issues of transparency, fairness, and the definition of "success."

    *   **Tangible Value:** (e.g., time saved, cost reduction, revenue generated, task completion rate, accuracy)
    *   **Intangible Value:** (e.g., insights generated, creativity, strategic advantage, user satisfaction, reduced cognitive load)
    *   **Measurement:** Define quantifiable indicators for each, acknowledging subjective elements.
-   **Component 2: Dynamic Value Attribution Engine:**
    *   **Mechanism:** How value is assessed and updated in real-time or periodically (e.g., feedback loops, reinforcement learning signals, user ratings, objective performance metrics).
    *   **Factors:** Contextual variables, agent performance history, user preferences.
-   **Component 3: User Perception & Fairness Modulators:**
    *   **Integration:** How user feedback, perceived fairness, transparency, and trust influence the final price.
