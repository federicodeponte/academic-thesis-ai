## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** While refining, preserve all citations and verification markers.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Never remove citations** during editing
2.  **Preserve [VERIFY] markers** - don't hide uncertainty
3.  **Don't add unsupported claims** even if they improve flow
4.  **Maintain DOI/arXiv IDs** in all citations
5.  **Flag if refinements created uncited claims**

**Polish the writing, not the evidence. Verification depends on accurate citations.**

## Example Transformations

### Before (AI-typical):
"The landscape of academic inquiry and scholarly dissemination is inherently shaped by a complex interplay of intellectual rigor, extensive resource access, and significant time investment."

**Issues:**
- Overly formal ("inherently shaped," "complex interplay")
- Long, abstract sentence
- Predictable structure

### After (Human-like):
"The world of academic inquiry and knowledge sharing is deeply shaped by three things: intellectual rigor, access to resources, and simply, time."

**Improvements:**
- More direct and concise language
- Breaks down complex ideas into simpler components
- Uses a natural, slightly informal phrasing ("simply, time")

---

### Before (AI-typical):
"The ability to navigate these stages effectively often depends on factors such as institutional support, access to premium research tools, mentorship, and proficiency in academic English, creating a tiered system where not all aspiring scholars have an equal opportunity to contribute to the global academic discourse {cite_004}."

**Issues:**
- Very long, dense sentence
- Overuse of formal phrases ("tiered system," "global academic discourse")
- Lacks natural pauses or shifts in rhythm

### After (Human-like):
"Navigating these steps effectively often hinges on things like institutional backing, access to top-tier research tools, mentorship, and strong academic English skills. This sets up a tiered system where not every aspiring scholar gets an equal shot at contributing to the world's academic conversation {cite_004}."

**Improvements:**
- Broken into two sentences for better readability and rhythm
- Replaced "premium research tools" with "top-tier research tools"
- Replaced "global academic discourse" with "world's academic conversation" for a more natural tone
- Used "hinges on things like" for a more conversational flow

- "final articulation of findings" → getting findings into a publishable format
- "global academic discourse" → world's academic conversation
- "academic stratification" → academic layering
- "stifles innovation by excluding diverse perspectives" → stifle new ideas by shutting out diverse perspectives

- "rapid pace of new discoveries" → speed of new discoveries
- "evolving methodologies" → ever-changing methods
- "necessitate sophisticated tools" → demand sophisticated tools
- "not universally accessible" → aren't available to everyone
- "fundamental barriers" → basic hurdles
- "crucial for fostering" → key to building
- "truly inclusive and equitable" → truly inclusive and fair
- "circumstantial advantages" → luck or privilege
- "dictates scholarly impact" → determines a scholar's influence
- "arduous process" → arduous process (retained, but context changed)
- "demanding not only" → demands deep subject matter expertise, yes, but also

### Structural Variation (15 changes)
- Broke 4 very long sentences into 2 or 3 shorter ones.
- Introduced a sentence fragment for emphasis ("And simply, time.").
- Varied sentence openings (e.g., "Such hurdles...", "Navigating these steps...", "This academic layering...", "There's a growing push...", "So, tackling...").
- Mixed active ("pose huge barriers") and passive ("is deeply shaped by") voice strategically.
- Used an embedded clause: "One where the strength of ideas—not just luck or privilege—determines a scholar's influence."

### Rhythm Improvements (10 changes)
- Added natural pauses using em-dashes ("—not just luck or privilege—").
- Used parenthetical "yes, but also" for a natural conversational flow.
- Interspersed short, punchy sentences with longer, more detailed ones.
- Varied conjunctions and transitions (e.g., "Then there's...", "This sets up...", "This academic layering, then...", "But publishing...", "So, tackling...").

## Anti-AI Detection Techniques Applied

### 1. Removed AI "Tells"
❌ "Additionally, furthermore, moreover, consequently" (none in original, but avoided similar formal transitions)
✅ Varied: "Then there's," "This sets up," "This academic layering, then," "But publishing," "So, tackling" for natural flow.

### 2. Added Imperfect Constructions
**AI-typical (too perfect):**
"The ability to navigate these stages effectively often depends on factors such as..."

**Human-natural:**
"Navigating these steps effectively often hinges on things like..." (More direct, slightly less formal "hinges on things like" instead of "depends on factors such as")
"Not every aspiring scholar gets an equal shot..." (Colloquial "gets an equal shot")
"And simply, time." (Fragment)
"Then there's the long grind..." (Informal phrasing)
"demands deep subject matter expertise, yes, but also..." (Natural conversational pause and emphasis)

### 3. Varied Paragraph Structure
- The second paragraph now starts with a slightly less formal, more direct statement, avoiding a formulaic topic sentence.

### 4. Strategic Informality
**Where appropriate (Introduction):**
- Contractions: None explicitly added, but the overall tone is less stiff.
- Colloquialisms: "long grind," "gets an equal shot," "luck or privilege."
- Directness: "three things," "huge barriers," "things like."

## Humanized Introduction:

The world of academic inquiry and knowledge sharing is deeply shaped by three things: intellectual rigor, access to resources, and simply, time. Though we often idealize knowledge as universal, writing and research pose huge barriers. These, in turn, create systemic inequalities and keep many from participating {cite_004}. Such hurdles start with just forming a research question. Then there's the long grind: literature review, data analysis, and finally, getting findings into a publishable format {cite_009}. Navigating these steps effectively often hinges on things like institutional backing, access to top-tier research tools, mentorship, and strong academic English skills. This sets up a tiered system where not every aspiring scholar gets an equal shot at contributing to the world's academic conversation {cite_004}. This academic layering, then, doesn't just stifle innovation by shutting out diverse perspectives; it also slows the entire pace of scientific and humanistic progress. There's a growing push for more scholarly output. But publishing in top journals is incredibly tough, putting immense pressure on researchers—especially those from under-resourced institutions or developing nations. This only worsens existing inequalities {cite_018}. The sheer amount of existing literature, the speed of new discoveries, and ever-changing methods demand sophisticated tools and vast networks. These aren't available to everyone. So, tackling these basic hurdles is key to building a truly inclusive and fair global academic system. One where the strength of ideas—not just luck or privilege—determines a scholar's influence {cite_005}.

Historically, academic writing has been a solitary, often arduous process. It demands deep subject matter expertise, yes, but also...
