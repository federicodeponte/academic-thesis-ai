I understand you want me to analyze research gaps in "open source impact."

However, the input you've provided is an error message from the **Scribe Agent**, stating:

> "I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request to summarize research findings.
> The `research/sources.md` content provided from the Scout Agent shows that **no citations were found**. The "Citations Found" section is empty.
> My role as a RESEARCH SCRIBE is to deep-read and summarize actual academic papers. Since there are no papers listed for analysis, I have no content to process according to the "Analysis Framework" and "Output Format" specified."

As the **Signal Agent**, my task is to analyze **paper summaries from the Scribe Agent**. Since the Scribe Agent was unable to find or summarize any papers, I have no summaries to analyze for research gaps, trends, contradictions, or opportunities.

To proceed, please ensure the Scribe Agent successfully processes a list of papers and generates the `research/summaries.md` file. Once you have that output, provide it to me, and I will be able to perform the research gap analysis.
