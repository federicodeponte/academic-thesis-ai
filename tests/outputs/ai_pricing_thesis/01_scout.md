Okay, I am ready. As an expert **RESEARCH SCOUT**, I will now search for academic papers and industry reports on AI agent pricing models, token-based pricing for LLMs, usage-based vs value-based pricing, API pricing strategies, and economic models for AI services.

I will focus on identifying 30 highly relevant papers, prioritizing recent publications (2020-2024) and foundational works where appropriate, and ensure the output is in the specified JSON format with verifiable details.

---

**Search Strategy Execution:**

1.  **Understand the Topic:**
    *   **Core Concepts:** AI agent pricing, LLM token pricing, usage-based pricing, value-based pricing, API pricing strategies, economic models for AI services.
    *   **Key Domains:** Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning, NLP), Economics, Business/Management, Software Engineering.
    *   **Date Range:** Primarily 2020-2024, but open to highly impactful earlier works on economic models or API pricing that are foundational.
    *   **Target Count:** 30 papers/reports.

2.  **Multi-Database Search (Simulated using broad knowledge base):**

    *   **Semantic Scholar & Google Scholar (Primary for breadth and business/economics focus):**
        *   `"AI agent pricing models"`
        *   `"LLM token pricing"` OR `"large language model pricing economics"`
        *   `"usage-based pricing AI services"` OR `"value-based pricing artificial intelligence"`
        *   `"API pricing strategies AI"` OR `"artificial intelligence API economics"`
        *   `"economic models for AI services"` OR `"pricing models machine learning"`
        *   `"generative AI monetization"`
        *   `"cost models large language models"`

    *   **arXiv (for cutting-edge AI/ML research):**
        *   `"LLM pricing"` OR `"transformer pricing"`
        *   `"AI agent economics"`
        *   `"cost analysis generative AI"`

    *   **Filtering & Selection:** I will aggregate results, remove duplicates, and apply quality filters (relevance, recency, credibility, impact). Given the nascent nature of "AI agent pricing models" specifically, I anticipate finding more work on broader "AI service economics," "LLM cost optimization," and general "API pricing strategies" which can be applied. I will prioritize papers that explicitly discuss LLMs, tokens, and agent-like systems. I will also look for well-regarded industry analysis or white papers that discuss these topics, especially if they are frequently cited in academic discussions.

3.  **Result Curation & Ranking:**
    I will select 30 papers, aiming for a balance of direct relevance to LLM/agent pricing, foundational economic models applicable to AI services, and different pricing strategies (usage-based, value-based). I will prioritize recent publications, but include a few seminal works on pricing or AI economics if they provide essential context.
