## Style Guide

### Academic Tone
- ✅ **Use:** "The results indicate...", "We observed...", "This suggests..."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Obviously...", "Clearly...", "It's interesting that..."

### Tense Usage
- **Introduction:** Present tense (current state, significance)
- **Literature Review:** Past tense (what others found), Present tense (what existing theories state)
- **Conceptual Framework & Methodology:** Past tense (what you did to develop the framework, how cases were selected), Present tense (describing the framework itself)
- **Framework & Case Studies:** Present tense (describing the framework), Past tense (what was observed in the case studies)
- **Discussion:** Present tense (what the findings mean, implications)

### Voice
- **Active vs Passive:** Prefer active for clarity, passive for objectivity where appropriate.
- ✅ "We analyzed the data" (active, clear)
- ✅ "The data were analyzed" (passive, objective)
- For theoretical papers, "This framework proposes..." (active) or "The framework is proposed to..." (passive) are both acceptable.

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2. **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3. **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]
4. **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5. **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support (e.g., assertions in the literature review, claims about the framework's novelty)

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
