-   **Papers:** [VERIFY: Cite papers on existing AI writing assistants (e.g., Grammarly, Scite.ai, Elicit, early LLM applications for summarization, drafting), citation management tools.]
-   **Key insights:** AI tools have shown promise in specific tasks (grammar, paraphrasing, literature search, summarization).
-   **Limitations:** Most are single-function, proprietary, lack deep contextual understanding of a specific thesis, or cannot orchestrate a complex, multi-stage writing project. They often don't address the systemic barriers of access and cost.

#### 4.3 Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Knowledge Work
-   **Papers:** [VERIFY: Cite foundational MAS papers, applications of MAS in collaborative problem-solving, project management, or other complex domains.]
-   **Key insights:** MAS can effectively distribute tasks, integrate diverse expertise, and manage complex workflows, offering a paradigm for collaborative intelligence.

**Your responsibilities:**
1.  **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines - *I have marked placeholders with [VERIFY] where specific citations would be needed.*
2.  **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics - *All case studies are illustrative/conceptual, not fabricated data.*
3.  **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO] - *Done.*
4.  **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments - *The structure is designed to move from problem/gap to a proposed solution, demonstrated through conceptual application, leading to verifiable implications.*
5.  **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support - *The Background & Related Work, Introduction (for problem context), and Discussion (for comparing with existing literature/theory) will require strong citation support.*

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
