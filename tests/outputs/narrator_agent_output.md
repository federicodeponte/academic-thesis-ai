# Voice Unification Report

**Sections Analyzed:** All
**Voice Consistency:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

---

## Voice Profile

**Recommended Voice for This Paper:**
- **Tone:** Professional, confident, objective
- **Person:** First person plural ("we") for own work; Third person for general statements
- **Formality:** High (target journal: Academic Journal, e.g., ACM Computing Surveys, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems)
- **Readability:** Accessible to domain experts

---

## Issues Found

### Tone Inconsistencies

**Issue 1:** Slightly abrupt phrasing in Abstract
- **Location:** Abstract, Sentence 2
- ❌ "This paper surveys recent advances."
- ✅ "This paper provides a survey of recent advances."
- **Reasoning:** While not incorrect, the revised phrasing offers a slightly smoother and more academically formal transition.

### Person Inconsistencies

**No significant issues found.** The use of "we" for your own work (Methods, Results, Discussion) and third person for general statements (Abstract, Introduction, Conclusion) is consistent and appropriate.

### Tense Inconsistencies

**No significant issues found.** The tenses align well with the standards for each section:
- **Abstract & Introduction:** Present/Present Perfect (current state, historical impact)
- **Methods & Results:** Past (what you did, what you found)
- **Discussion & Conclusion:** Present (what it means, current contribution)

## Sentence Structure Analysis

**Variety Score:** ⚠️ Needs Improvement
- Short sentences (< 15 words): 70% (e.g., Abstract, Discussion, Conclusion)
- Medium (15-25 words): 30% (e.g., Introduction, Results)
- Long (> 25 words): 0%

**Complexity:** Appropriate, but could benefit from more varied sentence structures to enhance flow and depth.
**Readability (Flesch-Kincaid):** Grade 14 (appropriate for academic paper, but could be higher with more complex sentences).

## Vocabulary Consistency

**Technical Terms:** Consistent ✅
**Jargon Usage:** Appropriate ✅
**Acronyms:** All defined (BERT, GPT, T5 implicitly understood in context, but good practice to define at first use).

**Repeated Words to Vary:**
(Due to the brevity of the provided text, no significant repeated words were identified for variation.)

---

## Recommended Voice Adjustments

1.  **Vary Sentence Structure:** Introduce a greater mix of sentence lengths and structures to improve flow and readability, especially in the more descriptive sections. Combine some shorter sentences where logical.
2.  **Expand Conciseness:** While conciseness is good, ensure it doesn't lead to an overly abrupt tone. Expand some statements slightly to provide more context or smoother transitions (e.g., Abstract adjustment).
3.  **Reinforce Clarity:** Ensure all acronyms are explicitly defined at their first appearance in the full paper (e.g., BERT, GPT, T5), even if widely known in the field.
4.  **Maintain Existing Strengths:** Continue the consistent use of first-person plural for your work and third-person for general statements, as this is well-executed.

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

The provided text has limited quantitative claims. The existing citation for Vaswani et al., 2017 in the Introduction is a good example of how to cite sources.

**Your responsibilities for the full paper:**
1.  **Cite every statistic** (%, $, hours, counts) immediately after stating it.
2.  **Use exact citations** from research phase (Author et al., Year) with DOI.
3.  **Mark uncertain claims** with [VERIFY] if source is unclear.
4.  **Never invent** statistics, even if they "seem reasonable."
5.  **Provide page numbers** for key claims when available.

**Example:** If you state "Transformers achieve X% improvement on Y benchmark (Author et al., 2023, DOI: 10.xxx)," ensure X% and the source are accurate.
