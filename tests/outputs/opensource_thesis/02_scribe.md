### Methodological Trends
-   **Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR):** Papers like Iqbal & Suzianti (2021) and Okoli (2009) use SLRs to synthesize existing knowledge, identify gaps, and establish foundational understanding in specific sub-domains of open innovation. This indicates a maturing field moving towards consolidating its knowledge base.
-   **Empirical Studies (Quantitative & Qualitative):** There's a strong presence of empirical work, ranging from quantitative analyses (Ullah & Morisio, 2013 on defects; Ghafele & Gibert, 2014 on employment) to qualitative case studies (Barbosa et al., 2022 on crisis NPD; Peters et al., 2022 on OSH). Mixed-methods approaches, as seen in Franke et al. (2024) on GDPR compliance, are also emerging to capture both breadth and depth.
-   **Conceptual & Discussion Papers:** A significant number of papers remain conceptual, proposing frameworks or discussing ideas (Ahlers, 2025 on urban ecosystems; Spina, 2007 on biotech; Skiba, 2005 on cathedral/bazaar). This reflects an ongoing effort to define, theorize, and expand the boundaries of open source and open innovation.
-   **Tool Development & Applied Research:** Papers like Mariette et al. (2021) demonstrate the development of open-source tools for specific applications (e.g., carbon footprint assessment), showcasing the practical output and problem-solving capability of the open source paradigm.
-   **Experience Reports:** He et al. (2023) exemplifies the use of experience reports to share practical insights and pedagogical approaches in open source education, indicating a focus on knowledge transfer and best practices.

### Contradictions or Debates
-   **Open Source Security Paradox:** While some papers implicitly or explicitly suggest that the transparency of open source leads to better security (Plevnik & Gumzej, 2025), others directly address the severe cybersecurity challenges and vulnerabilities inherent in OSS (Martinez & Durán, 2021; Hendrick & Mckeay, 2022). This creates a debate: is open source inherently more secure due to "many eyes," or are its distributed nature and complex dependencies a greater risk? The consensus seems to be that it's neither inherently secure nor insecure, but rather requires proactive, dedicated security practices.
-   **Generality of Open Source Principles:** Spina (2007) asks if open source principles can apply to biotechnology, highlighting the debate on the generalizability of the open source model beyond software. While papers on Open Source Hardware (Peters et al., 2022) and Open Urban Innovation (Ahlers, 2025) suggest broader applicability, the unique challenges of IP, regulation, and physical production in these domains often necessitate significant adaptation, indicating that a direct transfer is not always straightforward.
-   **Formal vs. Informal Governance:** Skiba (2005)'s "cathedral vs. bazaar" model highlights a fundamental tension between centralized, hierarchical control and decentralized, emergent collaboration. Barbosa et al. (2022) further explore this by showing how emergent, informal coordination can be highly effective in crisis-driven NPD, raising questions about the optimal balance between formal governance structures and agile, self-organizing communities in open innovation.

## Gaps for Further Investigation

Based on these papers, gaps to explore:
1.  **Longitudinal studies on the real-world impact of legal readiness in public sector OSS adoption:** While Madduri et al. (2023) discuss legal readiness, few papers quantitatively track the long-term effects of specific legal reforms on the actual adoption rates, cost savings, or public service improvements resulting from OSS implementation.
2.  **Economic models for sustaining open source projects addressing societal challenges:** Papers like Sandberg (2023) and Caddle et al. (2021) highlight open source for sustainability and youth safety, but there is limited work on sustainable funding models, incentive structures, and governance mechanisms that ensure the longevity and impact of such public-good oriented open source initiatives.
3.  **Comparative studies on human-AI collaboration across different open source project types and scales:** Newton et al. (2022) open the door to human-machine teams, but more research is needed to understand how bot integration affects projects of varying sizes, maturity levels, and domains (e.g., kernel development vs. web applications), and how this impacts diversity and inclusion.
4.  **Empirical validation of Open Source Hardware (OSH) business models and supply chain resilience:** Peters et al.
