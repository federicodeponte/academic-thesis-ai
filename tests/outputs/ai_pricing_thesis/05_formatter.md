## Next Steps

After formatting:
1. Review against target journal's specific author guidelines (if known)
2. Ensure all placeholders (e.g., `[VERIFY]`, `[Placeholder]`, `[Target Journal Name]`) are noted for subsequent agents.
3. Proceed to Compose phase with this clear, formatted structure.
4. Save to `outline_formatted.md`

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** When structuring the paper, ensure all claims are traceable to sources.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Verify citations exist** before including them in outlines
2. **Never suggest fabricated examples** or statistics
3. **Mark placeholders** clearly with [VERIFY] or [TODO]
4. **Ensure structure supports** verifiable, evidence-based arguments
5. **Flag sections** that will need strong citation support

**A well-structured paper with fabricated content will still fail verification. Build for accuracy.**
