## Content

This research employs a theoretical modeling approach, drawing upon economic principles and case study analysis to develop and evaluate a value-based pricing framework for agentic AI systems.  The methodology is structured in three primary stages: (a) framework construction, (b) comparative analysis, and (c) illustrative case studies.

### Framework Construction

The value-based pricing framework is constructed through an interdisciplinary synthesis of economic theory and AI agent literature.  We integrate concepts from behavioral economics, specifically prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), to account for the perceived value of AI agent services by users.  Prospect theory posits that individuals evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point and are more sensitive to losses than to gains.  This insight is critical for understanding how users perceive the value of AI agent outputs, particularly in situations where outcomes are uncertain or involve potential risks.  Furthermore, we incorporate principles of value pricing (Anderson et al., 1993), which emphasizes aligning pricing with the perceived benefits that customers receive.  This involves identifying key value drivers—attributes of AI agent performance that are highly valued by users—and developing pricing strategies that reflect these drivers.  Specifically, the framework considers the following components:

1.  *Identification of Value Drivers.* This involves determining the key attributes of AI agent performance that are most valued by users, such as accuracy, speed, reliability, and personalization.  We utilize a literature review and expert interviews to identify these value drivers within various application domains.

2.  *Quantification of Value Metrics.*  Once value drivers are identified, we develop metrics to quantify their impact on user outcomes.  For example, accuracy may be measured by precision and recall, while speed may be measured by response time.  These metrics provide a basis for assessing the incremental value provided by AI agents relative to alternative solutions.

3.  *Formulation of Pricing Models.* The framework incorporates various pricing models, including cost-plus pricing, competitive pricing, and value-based pricing. Cost-plus pricing involves adding a markup to the cost of providing the AI agent service, while competitive pricing involves setting prices based on the prices of competing solutions. Value-based pricing, on the other hand, involves setting prices based on the perceived value of the AI agent service to the user.

The resulting framework provides a structured approach for comparing the effectiveness of token-based pricing models with value-based approaches in capturing and delivering value to users.

### Comparative Analysis

The comparative analysis assesses the strengths and limitations of token-based pricing models versus value-based pricing. This involves evaluating the economic efficiency of each pricing model based on its ability to incentivize desired behaviors, align incentives between AI agent providers and users, and promote optimal resource allocation (Varian, 2010). Token-based pricing, while straightforward to implement, may not accurately reflect the value generated by AI agents, particularly in situations where output quality varies (Shumailov et al., 2023).  This misalignment can lead to inefficient resource allocation and suboptimal outcomes.  Value-based pricing, on the other hand, has the potential to better align incentives by linking pricing to the perceived value of AI agent services. However, implementing value-based pricing can be challenging due to the difficulty of accurately measuring and attributing value.

A key component of the comparative analysis involves constructing a decision-theoretic model that represents the tradeoffs faced by users when selecting AI agent services. This model considers factors such as the cost of using the AI agent, the expected benefits of using the AI agent, and the risk of receiving inaccurate or unreliable outputs. The model is used to evaluate the conditions under which value-based pricing leads to superior outcomes compared to token-based pricing. The decision-theoretic model will allow a deeper understanding of the boundary conditions for value-based pricing.

### Illustrative Case Studies

To illustrate the applicability and advantages of the value-based pricing framework, we conduct three case studies across diverse application domains: (a) healthcare diagnostics, (b) financial trading, and (c) legal research. These domains were selected based on their high stakes, data intensity, and varying degrees of human oversight. The use of multiple case studies is critical to establish the external validity of the framework in differing contexts (Yin, 2018).

*Case Study Selection Criteria.* Cases were chosen based on the availability of data, relevance to the research question, and diversity of application domains. We prioritized cases where the value generated by AI agents could be reasonably quantified and attributed to specific inputs and outputs.

*Data Collection.* Data was collected from publicly available sources, industry reports, and expert interviews. This data included information on AI agent performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, speed), pricing models, and user outcomes (e.g., diagnostic accuracy, investment returns, legal research efficiency).

*Analysis Approach.*  Each case study involves a detailed analysis of the AI agent value chain, including the inputs required to generate AI agent outputs, the processes involved in transforming inputs into outputs, and the outcomes resulting from the use of AI agent outputs. We estimate the value generated by AI agents in each case study by comparing the outcomes achieved using AI agents to the outcomes achieved using alternative solutions. We also assess the impact of different pricing models on the incentives of AI agent providers and users, and on the allocation of resources. We analyze the sensitivity of our conclusions to different assumptions and parameter values.

The case studies provide concrete examples of how the value-based pricing framework can be applied in practice, and highlight the potential benefits of aligning pricing with the perceived value of AI agent services.
