## Readability Metrics

**Note:** Due to the extremely short length of the provided text, quantitative readability metrics (like Flesch-Kincaid) would not be meaningful or accurate.

**Qualitative Assessment:**
*   **Before:** The abstract was concise but a bit abrupt. The introduction was cut off.
*   **After:** The abstract is slightly smoother and more formally introduces "Natural Language Processing (NLP)". The issue in the introduction is now clearly flagged for author decision.
