## üÜò Troubleshooting

**MCP tools not working?**
- Check IDE was restarted after installing MCP servers
- Verify mcp_config.json exists and is valid JSON
- Test individual servers (see `mcp_servers/README.md`)

**Agent responses too generic?**
- Attach more context (research notes, outline)
- Be specific in your instructions
- Iterate with follow-up prompts

**AI detection score too high?**
- Run Entropy Agent again
- Add more of your own writing samples to Voice Agent
- Manually edit some sections for variety

**Running out of time?**
- Prioritize: Research ‚Üí Structure ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Compose ‚Üí Refine
- Skip optional steps (Voice Agent)
- Focus on core sections (Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion)

**Need help?**
- Review agent prompt files for detailed instructions
- Check examples/ folder for sample outputs
- See README.md for setup issues
- Consult ETHICS.md for responsible use guidelines
